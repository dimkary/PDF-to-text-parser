 9 RISK FACTORS 
1. RISKS DERIVING FROM THE LEGAL STATUS AND BUSINESS OF THE 
ISSUER 1.1. Nature of the Fund and obligations of the Sociedad Gestora 
The Fund will constitute a closed, separate fund 
devoid of legal status that, pursuant to 
Royal Decree 926/1998, will be serviced by
 a securitization fund management company 
(hereinafter "Sociedad Gestora"). The Fund will 
only be liable for its obligations vis-à-vis 
its creditors with its assets. 
The Sociedad Gestora will perform in the future
 for the Fund those duties attributed to it 
in Royal Decree 926/1998, inter alia, safeguarding the interests of the Bondholders as the 
manager of third party funds, without 
there being any syndicate of Bondholders. 
Therefore the capacity to defend the Bondhol
ders' interests depends on the means and 
resources of the Sociedad Gestora. 
1.2. Mandatory substitution of the Sociedad Gestora 
In accordance with article 19 of Royal Decr
ee 926/1998, if the Sociedad Gestora is 
declared insolvent, without 
prejudice to the effects of su
ch insolvency as described 
below, or if its authorisation is withdrawn, it will find another sociedad gestora to 

substitute it. Whenever in the circumstances
 envisaged four (4) months have elapsed 
since the event requiring the substitution occu
rs and a new sociedad gestora that is 
prepared to take over the management has not 
been found, or the CNMV consider that the 
proposal is not suitable, the Fund will be
 liquidated early and the Bonds will be 
redeemed, in accordance with the pr
ovisions of this Prospectus. 1.3. Insolvency of the Sociedad Gestora, of the Seller and of other entities 
The insolvency of any of the parties involved (whether it be CAJA MADRID, the 
Sociedad Gestora or any other counterparty entity of the Fund) could affect their 

contractual relations with the Fund as provided in the Ley Concursal 22/2003 of 9 July 
(Spanish Insolvency Act or the ﬁLey Concursalﬂ).  In this respect, if the Sociedad Gestora is 
declared bankrupt, it must be substituted by 
another Sociedad Gestora in accordance with the 
provisions of the previous section of this 
Prospectus and of articles 18 and 19 of Royal Decree 926/1998.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of
 the insolvency of th
e Sociedad Gestora, 
any assets of the Fund that are in the possession 
of the Sociedad Gestora and with respect 
whereto the latter has no right of use, surety or retention -except for money due to its 

fungible nature- and that form part of the la
tter's assets will be construed as belonging to 
the Fund, and the receivers in bankruptcy must
 deliver them when requested to do so by 
the Sociedad Gestora (or the so
ciedad gestora that replaces it) on behalf of the Fund. Due 
to the nature of the asset securitisation opera
tion in question, and except in the event of a 
breach by the parties, no cash amounts will b
ecome part of the assets of the Sociedad 
Gestora because the amounts that constitute th
e revenues of the Fund must be deposited, 


 10 
in the terms set forth in the Prospectus, in the accounts opened at different financial 
institutions on behalf of the Fund by the 
Sociedad Gestora (which will be involved in 
opening such accounts not only as the agent of the Fund, but as its legal representative.  

Therefore the Fund would be entitled to absolute
 separation in this respect, in the terms 
set forth in articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal). 
In the event of the insolvency of CAJA 
MADRID, the issue and subscription of the 
Certificates may be returned only if an action 
for such return is pursued in which fraud is 
demonstrated to have existed in that issue 
and sale in accordance with the provisions of 
the paragraph 4 of the Fifth Additional Provi
sion of Ley 3/1994 of 14 April, adapting 
Spanish legislation regarding credit institutions to the Second Banking Coordination 
Directive and introducing other modifi
cations to the financial system (ﬁ
Ley 3/1994ﬂ), and Section 15 of Ley 2/1981, of 25 March 
(the Mortgage Market Act or the ﬁ
Ley del 
Mercado Hipotecario
ﬂ).  In the event that CAJA MADR
ID is declared insolvent under the Ley Concursal, the 
Fund, acting through the Sociedad Gestora, w
ill be entitled to separation with respect to 
the Multiple Certificate in the terms set forth in articles 80 and 81 of the Ley Concursal. 

Furthermore the Fund, acting through its Soci
edad Gestora, will be entitled to secure from 
CAJA MADRID the amounts derived from the 
Certificates, because such amounts will be 
construed as the property of the Fund and, therefore, must be transferred to the Sociedad 
Gestora on behalf of the Fund. Nevertheless, it might not be possible to exercise such 

separation right with respect to (i) the f
unds handled by CAJA MADRID, for the account 
of the Fund, in exercising its duty of managing the collection of the Mortgage Loans and 

(ii) the money on deposit in the Fund A
ccount opened by CAJA MADRID, in both cases 
as at the date the insolvency 
was declared, due to the fungible nature of money and the 
consequent confusion of assets. The mechanis
ms available for mitigating such risk are 
described in sections 3.4.4.1 (Treasury Account
), 3.4.5 (How payments are collected in 
respect of the assets) and 3.7.1 (Servicing a
nd custody of the Mortgage Loans and deposit 
of the Certificates) of the Additional Building Block. 
1.4. Restricted actions against the Sociedad Gestora 
The Bondholders and remaining ordinary cred
itors of the Fund will have no recourse 
against the Sociedad Gestora, other than
 from non-performance of its duties or non-
compliance with the provisions of the Deed
 of Incorporation and this Prospectus. 
1.5. Information sourced from third parties 
The Sociedad Gestora, acting for and on behalf
 of the Fund, will enter into contracts with 
third parties for the provision of services rega
rding the Bonds and will enter into contracts in order to consolidate the financial struct
ure of the Fund. These include the Certificate 
servicing service set forth in the Deed of In
corporation, the Accrued Interest Loan 
Agreement, the Subordinated Loan Agreement,
 the Participative Loan Agreement, the 
Interest Swap Agreement, the Option Agreem
ents, the Financial Services Contract and 
the Placement Management, Subscr
iption and Underwriting Contract. 
The Bondholders' interests could be impaired
 if any of the aforementioned parties 
breaches the obligations acquired under any 
of the aforementioned contracts or 
agreements. 


 11 
2. RISK DERIVED FROM THE BONDS 
2.1. Liquidity There is no guarantee that a minimum volume or frequency of Bond transactions will be 
forthcoming in the market. 
There is no commitment that any entity will in
tervene in the secondary market, providing 
liquidity to the Bonds by offering itself as counterparty. 
Furthermore, under no circumstances will the 
Fund be able to repurchase the Bonds from 
their holders, although the Bonds can be re
deemed early in full in the case of early 
liquidation, under the terms established in 
section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document. 
2.2. Yield of the Bonds The calculation of the internal rate of return (ﬁ
IRR
ﬂ) for each Bondholder that is 
stipulated in section 4.10. of the Securities No
te, is subject, inter alia, to future market 
interest rates, given the floating nature of th
e Nominal Interest Rate of each Series, and to 
early redemption and default rate hypot
heses that might not be fulfilled. 
2.3. Term of the Bonds The  calculation of the average life and the te
rm of the Bonds mentioned in section 4.10. 
of the Securities Note is subject, inter a
lia, to Mortgage Loan early redemption and 
default rate hypotheses that might not be fulfilled.  Fulfilment of the early redemption rate 
is influenced by a variety of demographi
c, economic and social factors, such as 
seasonality, market interest rates, the empl
oyment and financial situation of the 
Mortgagors and the general state of the 
economy, that make this unpredictable. 
2.4. Default interest  
Under no circumstances will the delay of the payment of interest or repayment of 
principal to the Bondholders give rise to 
accrual of default interest in their favour. 
3. RISKS DERIVED FROM THE ASSETS BACKING THE ISSUE 
3.1. Risk of default on the Mortgage Loans 
The Bondholders will bear the risk of defau
lt on the Mortgage Loans pooled in the Fund 
through the issue of the Certificates, always taking into account the protection offered by 

the credit enhancement mechanisms referre
d to in section 3.4.2 of the Additional 
Building Block.  
CAJA MADRID, in its capacity as Seller 
and in accordance with article 348 of the 
Commercial Code, will only be held liable 
vis-à-vis the Fund fo
r the existence and 
legitimacy of the Mortgage Loans and the 
Certificates, in the 
terms and conditions 
declared in the Deed of Incorporation and that
 are set forth in this Prospectus, as well as 
for the legal status with which it carries out
 the sale. However, it will not assume any 
liability for the non-payment by the Mortgagors, be it of the principal, of the interest or 


 12 
any other amount they may owe by virtue of th
e Mortgage Loans, or for the solvency of 
the latter. Likewise, it will not be held liable, in any form whatsoever, for directly or 
indirectly guaranteeing the successful conclusi
on of this transaction, nor will it grant 
collateral or bank guarantees, nor will it en
ter into agreements
 to repurchase the 
Certificates, whether pursuant to the Deed of In
corporation, or to this Prospectus, or to 
any other agreement or contract. All of th
is, without prejudice to CAJA MADRID being 
held liable for the replacement of the Ce
rtificates that do not conform to the 
representations set forth in section 2.2.8 of 
the Additional Building Block, regarding the 
commitments given in sections 2.2.9 and 3.7.1 of the Additional Building Block.  
The Bonds do not represent or constitute an obligation of CAJA MADRID or of the 
Sociedad Gestora. No other guarantees have 
been granted by any public or private 
entities, including CAJA MADRID,
  the Sociedad Gestora, and any other firm affiliated 
with or invested in by any of the above. 
3.2. Limited protection An investment in the Bonds may be affected
, inter alia, by a worsening of the general 
economic conditions that have

3.3. Risk of early redemption of the Mortgage Loans 
The Certificates may be prepaid when the Mort

the Mortgage Loans, in the terms set forth in 
each Mortgage Loan deed, or in the event of 
CAJA MADRID being subrogated in the co

financial institution duly authorised for such pur
pose, subject to Act 2/1994, of 30 March,

Bondholders in accordance with the repayment 
rules set forth in section 4.9 of the 
Securities Note.  Consequently, there may be 
changes in the repayment of the Bonds with 
respect to the amounts initially scheduled for each Payment Date.

4.4.1 Date of Incorporation of the Fund 
The Sociedad Gestora, together with CAJA

has been registered, to grant on 11 July 2007 (the ﬁ
Date of Incorporation
ﬂ) the Deed of 
Incorporation, in the terms set forth in Article 6 of Royal Decree 926/1998.  
4.4.2 Length of life of the Fund The length of life of the Fund will run from the Date of Incorporation provided for in the 
previous section until the legal maturity da
te of the Fund, on which the Fund will be 
extinguished scheduled for 22 February 2050 
(which coincides with the Payment Date 
immediately subsequent to the da
te obtained by adding thirty-six (36) months to the last 
redemption date of the Mortgage Loans) or, if
 this day is not a Business Day, the next 
Business Day), (the ﬁ
Legal Maturity Date
ﬂ), without detriment to the Sociedad Gestora, 
on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, 
prior to such date, proceeding to the early 
liquidation of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the next section.  
4.4.3 Early liquidation and extinction of the Fund  
Notwithstanding the above, pursuant to the future
 provisions of the Deed of Incorporation 
and the provisions of this Prospectus, the Soci
edad Gestora will be authorised to proceed 
to carry out the early liquidation of the Fund and hence the early redemption of the 

Bonds, when on a Payment Date (as such is defined in section 4.8.1 of the Securities 
Note) the sum of the Receivable Nominal Bala
nce of the Certificates on the last day of 
the Calculation Period immediately prior to th
e Payment Date in question is less than ten 
per cent (10%) of the Receivable Nomi
nal Balance of the Certificates on the 
Incorporation Date, provided that (i) the 
authorisation necessary to do so has been 
obtained from the competent authorities; and 
(ii) the liquidation of the Certificates 
pending repayment, together with the balan
ce that exists at that time in the Treasury 
Account and/or, where applicable, in the Tr
easury  Surplus Account), permits the full 
repayment of all the Fund's outstanding obligations vis-à-vis the Bondholders, in 

accordance with the provisions of this section, and respecting any prior payments that are 

to be given priority, in accordance with th
e Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. 
It is understood, in all cases, that paymen
t obligations derived from the Bonds on the 
Early Liquidation Date mean the Receivable No
minal Balance of the Bonds on that date, 
plus the unpaid accrued interest to that da
te, amounts that to all legal effects will be 
deemed at that date past due and payable. 
The Sociedad Gestora will proceed to li
quidate the Fund early, according to the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order set forth in section 3.4.6.3. of the Additional 
Building Block, in the following circumstan
ces, and the CNMV and the Rating Agencies 
will be informed beforehand if any of them occur:  


 16 
(i) When, in the opinion of the Sociedad G
estora, exceptional circumstances occur 
which make it impossible, or extremely diffi
cult, to maintain the financial balance 
of the Fund.  
(ii) In the event that the Sociedad Gestora is
 wound up, its authorization is withdrawn 
or it is declared bankrupt, and the time limit established by law for such purposes, 

or else four (4) months, have elapsed without a new sociedad gestora having been 

designated according to the provisions of 
section 3.7.2.2 of the Additional Building 
Block. (iii) When there is a non-payment indicative of a serious and permanent imbalance in 
relation to any of the Bonds or it is foreseen that it is going to occur.  (iv) When there is a change in the tax regul
ations, in accordance with the regulations 
applicable to the Fund and to the Bonds that, in the opinion of the Sociedad 
Gestora, has a significant and negative eff
ect on the financial balance of the Fund. 
(v) When thirty (30) months elapse since the 
date of maturity of the last Mortgage 
Loan pooled in the Fund, even if debits remain unpaid. 
The Fund will be extinguished, in any event,
 as a result of the following circumstances: 
(i) When the Certificates are repaid in full. In
 the event that all the Certificates have 
matured and amounts remain to be collected
 same and obligations remain to be 
paid to the Bondholders, the Fund will be extinguished on the Payment Date 
immediately after thirty-six (36) months elapse since the date of maturity of the last 

Mortgage, that is to say, 22 February 2050 
or, if it is not a Business Day, the next 
Business Day, which will coincide with the Final Maturity Date. 
(ii) When the Bonds are redeemed in full. 
(iii) Upon the completion of the early liquidation procedure. 
(iv) In the event that one of the provisional 
ratings assigned to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies is not confirmed before the start of the Bond subscription period, which 

will start at 9.00 a.m. (CET) on 17 July 2007 and will end at 11.00 a.m. (CET) on 

the same day (the ﬁ
Bond Subscription Period
ﬂ). In these cases, the incorporation 
of the Fund, the issue and subscription of 
the Certificates, the Fund's Contracts and 
the issue of the Bonds will be considered rescinded.  In this event of early termination of the Fund, the Seller will undertake to meet the Initial 
Expenses. In the event that, at the time of the final liquidation of the Fund, any outstanding 
obligations remain to be paid by the Fund to any of the Bondholders, the Sociedad 
Gestora may proceed in one of the following ways: 
It will proceed to sell the assets, for which pur
pose it will obtain bids from at least five (5) 
of the entities that deal most actively in these 
assets that, in its opinion, can give a market 
value. The starting price for the sale of all th
e Certificates will not be less than the sum of 


 17 
(a) the Receivable Nominal Balance of 
the Certificates plus (b) the accrued and 
uncollected interest of the Mortgage Loan
s to which they correspond. However, the 
Sociedad Gestora will be obliged to accept th
e best bid received for the assets made by 
such entities that meet the market value of  
the asset in question. In order to establish the 
market value, the Sociedad Gestora may re
quest any valuation reports that it deems 
necessary. The names of the independent e
xperts appointed will be reported to the 
CNMV and the Rating Agencies. 
In the event that the Fund is liquidated a
nd any amount of the Certificates remains 
unredeemed, CAJA MADRID will have a right 
of pre-emption to recover from the Fund 
the Certificates in the terms and conditions
 specified by the Sociedad Gestora and 
pursuant to the provisions of the previous pa
ragraph. The foregoing right of pre-emption 
does not, under any circumstances, imply an 
agreement or declaration to repurchase the 
Certificates given by CAJA MADRID. CAJA
 MADRID will have five (5) Business 
Days, counted from the date on which the Sociedad Gestora notifies it of the terms and 

conditions, in which it will proceed to dispose 
of the Certificates, to exercise the said 
right of pre-emption, and must at least 
match the best bid made by third parties. 
Proceed to terminate any contracts that ar
e not deemed necessary for the Fund liquidation 
process. 
Should that be insufficient or should loans or other assets remain, it will proceed to sell 
the other assets held by the Fund. The Socied
ad Gestora will be authorised to accept any 
bids that, in its opinion, meet the market va
lue of the asset in question and are paid in 
cash. In order to establish the market valu
e, the Sociedad Gestora may request the 
valuation reports it considers necessary. 
The Sociedad Gestora, after allocating the 
reserve to meet the expenses incurred in 
liquidating the Fund (the ﬁ
Extinction Expenses Reserve
ﬂ), will apply all the amounts 
that it obtains through the disposal of the asset
s of the Fund, together with the rest of the 
Available Funds that the Fund might have at that time, to the payment of the different 

items, in the form, amount and in accordance with the Liquidation Priority of Payment 

Order.   In the event that, once the Fund has been li
quidated and all the payments set forth in 
section 3.4.6.3 of the Additional Building Block 
have been made, there is any remainder, 
such remainder will be paid to the Seller. In
 the event that the remainder is not a liquid 
amount and consists of Certificates from Mo
rtgage Loans that are pending rulings with 
respect to court or notarial proceedings initia
ted as a result of by Mortgagor default, both 
their continuation and the outcome of the 
ruling will be in favour of the Seller.  
In any event, the Sociedad Gestora, acting 
on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, 
will not proceed to extinguish the Fund and 
to cancel its registration in the pertinent 
administrative registries until it has proceeded
 to sell the remaining assets of the Fund and 
to distribute the Available Funds, following the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, 
except for the Extinction Expenses Reserve. 
Six (6) months after the liquidation of the remaining assets of the Fund and the 
distribution of the Available Funds, the Socied
ad Gestora will grant an affidavit declaring 
(i) the extinction of the Fund, and the reasons
, as set forth in this Prospectus, for the 


 18 
termination, (ii) the procedure followed in
 notifying the Bondholders and the CNMV, and 
(iii) the distribution of the Available Funds in
 the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. 
This deed will be submitted by th
e Sociedad Gestora to the CNMV. 
4.5. Domicile and legal form of the issuer, the legislation applicable to the issuer 
The Fund will be incorporated in Spain, pursuant to the provisions of Royal Decree 
926/1998. 
The Fund will constitute a closed, separate fund 
devoid of legal status that, pursuant to 
Royal Decree 926/1998, will be serviced by
 a securitization fund management company 
(hereinafter "Sociedad Gestora"). Such So
ciedad Gestora will be responsible for the 
incorporation, servicing and representation of the Fund, and also, as the manager of third 

party funds, for representing and safeguarding th
e interests of holders of the bonds issued 
from the funds that it services and its other ordinary creditors. The Fund will only be 
liable for its obligations vis-à-vis its creditors with its assets. 
The Fund will be constituted and the Bonds will be issued from it in accordance with 
Spanish law and, specifically, with (i) Royal Decree 926/1998 and its implementing 

provisions; (ii) Law 19/1992 of 7 July, on the legal system applicable to Real Estate 

Investment Companies and Funds and Mortgage Securitisation Funds (ﬁ
Ley 19/1992

ee 926/1998 and insofar as applicable; (iii) 
Ley 3/1994; (iv) the Financial System Re
form Measures Act 44/2002, of 22 November 
(ﬁLey 44/2002ﬂ
) (in particular Section 18); (v) the

24/1988, of 28 July, in its current wording, (Securities Market Act or the ﬁ
Ley del 
Mercado de Valores
ﬂ), regarding its supervision, in
spection and penalties and any other 
applicable matters; and (vi) any other legal 
provisions prevailing from time to time that 
are applicable. 
This Registration Document has been draw
n up in accordance with the provisions of 
Regulation 809/2004. 
The registered office of the Fund will be Calle Orense 69, in Madrid (Spain), and its 
telephone number will be +34 91 702 08 08. 
4.5.1 Fund tax system 
There follows a brief summary of the general ta
x regulations applicable to the Fund. This 
must be construed without prejudice to the par
ticular nature of each local jurisdiction and 
of the regulations which may apply at the 
time the relevant income is obtained or 
declared. 
The tax regime applicable to Fondos de T
itulización de Activos (Asset Securitisation 
Funds) consists of the general 
provisions contained in the consolidated text of Corporate 
Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades), approved by Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004 

of 5 March, and its implementing provisions
, with the specific peculiarities arising from 
the provisions of Act 19/1992, in Ley 3/1994 and in Royal Decree 926/1998.  
The tax system may be summarised as follows: 


 19 
1. Asset Securitisation Funds are liable to Cor
porate Income Tax, subject to the general 
rules for determining the tax base, and to th
e general rate of 32.5 percent, which will 
be reduced to 30% for the financial years starting from 1 January 2008 onwards, and 

to the common rules for deductions, set-off of
 losses and other substantive elements 
of the tax. 2. Investment income from Securitisation F
unds is subject to the general rules on 
withholdings on account of Corporate Income Ta
x, with the particularity that article 
59-k of the Regulations approved by Royal Decree 1777/2004, of 30 July stipulates 
that withholding does not apply to ﬁincome from mortgage participating units, 

mortgage loans and other credit rights 
that constitute revenue items for the 
securitisation funds". Consequently, in addition to the income from the directly 

securitised Certificates, the withholding 
exemption also extends, according to the 
expressly stated policy of the Tax Authorities,
 to the income of the Mortgage Loans, 
insofar as they form part of the ordi
nary business activity of the said funds. 
3. The incorporation of Mortgage Securitisati
on Funds is exempt from classification as 
a Corporate Operation under Real Estate Transfer and Tax Stamp Duty, according to 

the provisions of Section Five (10) of Le
y 19/1992, and not subject to Tax Stamp 
Duty, under Section 31.2 of the Real Esta
te Transfer and Tax Stamp Duty Act. 
 Article 16 of Royal Decree-Law 3/1993, of 26 February, on urgent measures on 
budgetary, fiscal, financial and employment ma
tters, authorised the Government to 
"extend the regulations applicable to the 
securitisation of mortgage participations 
(–) to the securitisation of other loans and 
credit rights", such authorisation having 
been endorsed and extended by the Fifth Additional Provision of Ley 3/1994. 
 Furthermore, Royal Decree 926/1998 stipul
ates that any matters regarding Asset 
Securitization Funds that are not covered by the Decree will remain subject to the 

rules set forth in Ley 19/1992 for the mortga
ge securitisation funds, insofar as they 
are applicable, in terms of their specific nature. 
 Therefore, given that Royal Decree 926/1998 makes no reference to the tax 
treatment of Asset Securitization Funds, it 
could be construed that, although it is not 
an entirely pacific matter, in the light of 
the aforementioned regulatory authorisation, 
the tax benefits established for Mortgage 
Securitization Funds in Ley 19/1992 also 
apply to Asset Securitization Funds. 
 Consequently, if this interpretation were 
to prosper, the incorporation of the Fund 
would be subject to and exempt from classification as "corporate transactions" under 
Stamp Duty and from Real Estate Transf
er Tax ("Impuesto sobre Transmisiones 
Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documenta
dos"). However, this interpretation might 
be questioned, and therefore the transaction might become subject either to the 

Corporate Transaction Tax without being ex
empt, or to Stamp Duty and although 
neither of these circumstances were intended by the legislator, they might arise 
because each Regional Government is respons
ible for this Tax and therefore free to 
apply its own criterion.  
4. The transfer to the Fund of the Certificates 
provided for in the Deed of Incorporation 
in the manner described above is a transacti
on that is subject to, but qualifies for an 


 20 
exemption from Value Added Tax (ﬁ
VATﬂ), in accordance with the provisions of 
section 20.One. 18-e of the Value Added Tax Act 37/1992 of 28 December (ﬁ
Ley del 
IVAﬂ). The establishment and assignment of guarantees is subject to the general tax regime 
with no exceptions. 
5. The issue, subscription, transmission redemption and reimbursement of the 
Securitization Bonds will be exempt from
 VAT (article 20.One.18 of the Ley del 
IVA) and Capital Transfer Tax and Stam
p Duty (Impuesto sobre Transmisiones 
Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documenta
dos) (article 45.I.B, number 15, of the 
Consolidated Text of the Capital Transfer
 Tax and Stamp Duty Act, confirmed by the 
3 November 1997 judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court).  
6. The management and deposit services provided to the Fund by the Sociedad Gestora 
will be exempt from Value Added Tax, in
 accordance with the provisions of section 
20.One.18.n) of the Ley del IVA.  
7. The Fund will be subject to the informati
on obligations set forth in the Second 
Additional Provision of Act 13/1985, of 25 
May, on investment coefficients, own 
funds and information requirements for fina
ncial intermediaries, as amended by Act 
19/2003 of 4 July, on foreign capital move
ments and economic transactions, and on 
measures against money laundering, a
nd Law 23/2005, of 18 November, on tax 
reforms for boosting productivity. 
The procedure for complying with the said information obligations has been 
developed by Royal Decree 2281/1998 of 23 
October, developing the provisions 
applicable to certain obligations to provide
 information to the Tax Authorities, as 
amended by Royal Decree 1778/2004, of 30 July, that establishes the obligation to 
provide information regarding preferential units (ﬁparticipaciones preferencialesﬂ) 

and other debt instruments and regarding cer
tain income obtained by natural persons 
resident in the European Union. 
4.6. Description of the Issuer™s authorised a
nd issued capital and the amount of any 
capital agreed to be issued, the number and classes of the Bonds it comprises 
Not applicable. 5. BUSINESS OVERVIEW  5.1. Brief description of the Issuer™s main activities  
The Fund will be set up as a vehicle intended to carry out a concrete transaction, pursuing 
the principal activities summarised below a
nd explained in detail throughout this 
Prospectus. The Fund, on its Date of Incorporation, w
ill issue the Bonds with whose nominal amounts 
it will acquire the Certificates issued by 
CAJA MADRID, derived from a portfolio of 
Mortgage Loans owned by CAJA MADRID, 
the main characteristics of which are 
described in the Additional Building Block. 

 21 
Thus, through this transaction, CAJA MADRID will collect the Mortgage Loans in 
advance, in other words, assets that were not 
liquid at the time they were transferred to 
the Fund, become liquid for CAJA MADRID.

 4.2.2 Underwriting and placement of the Bonds 
On the Date of Incorporation and for the account of the Fund, the Sociedad Gestora will 
enter into a contract with the Arranger and 
with the Underwriting and Placement Agents mentioned in section 5.2 of the Registration Document, whereby 
the said entities under
-take to subscribe on their own behalf or to obtain, at their own responsibility, subscribers for one hundred per cent (100%) of the Class A, B, C, D and E Bonds, with each being 

held accountable for the respective amount it has underwritten. 
It is foreseen that, prior to the Date of In
corporation, it may be decided to include new 
Underwriting and Placement Agents and, before 1.30 p.m. (CET) of the second (2
nd) Bus-iness Day prior to the
 Disbursement Date, to modify their underw
riting commitments. 
In any event, the 
inclusion of 
new underwriting agents, as well as the definitivedistribution of the amounts of the 
respective underwriting commitments will 
be reported to the CNMV and will be
 registered in the disbursement certificate.  
The Underwriting and Placement Agents will assume the obligati
ons contained in the Placement Management, 
Subscription and Underwriting Contract:  
The Bonds will be placed during the Subscription Period. 
In consideration of the commitment undertaken by the 
Underwriting and Placement Agents, and pursuant to the Placement Management, Subscripti
on and Underwriting Contract, 
the latter will receive an underwriting and placement fee that will be a maximum of twenty 
(20)basis points of the amount nominal of the Bonds of the corresponding Series. A different fee 
                                                     
 1 Percentage of the total Bonds issued on the Date of Incorporation. 


 36 
may be stipulated, within the maximum established, for each of the Series and Classes 
underwritten, provided that the aggregate amount of the fees does not exceed three 
million six hundred thousand (3,600,000) euros. The global amount of the underwriting 
fee will be distributed among the 
Underwriting and Placement Agents pursuant to 
the provisions of the Placement Management, Subscrip
tion and Underwriting Contract. 
The amount of the underwriting fee, expressed as 
a percentage, will be determined by the 
Arranger and notified by the Arranger by fax to
 the Sociedad Gestora before the second 
(2nd) Business Day prior to the Disbursement Da
te.  If the fee is not notified on time, and 
without detriment to any liability deriving th
erefrom, the Sociedad Gestora will set the 
underwriting and placement fee that has not been notified properly, as 0.12% of the 
nominal amount of the Bonds of the Series in question, for the Series A, B, C, D and E 

Bonds. 
The amount of the underwriting and placement fee accrued in favour of each of the 
Under-writing and Placement Agents will be paid to them in a single
 payment on the Disburse
-ment Date, once they 
have paid the Fund the nominal value of the Bonds placed by each 

of the Underwriting and Placement Agents and, as applicable, subscribed by them 
for their own account up to their respective 
underwriting commitments. However, the 

Underwriting and Placement Agents will be entitled to deduct such 
fee from the amounts
 that they must deliver to the Fund.  
The fees payable to the 
Underwriting and Placement Agents will be
 construed as gross 
with respect to any tax 
or withholding applicable thereto. 
Subscribing or holding of Bonds of one 
series does not imply subscribing or holding 
Bonds of the other Series.

4.8. The nominal interest rate and provisions relating to interest payable 
Bond Interest 
All the Bonds issued will accrue, from the Di
sbursement Date and until they are fully 
redeemed, a floating annual nominal inter
est calculated on the Receivable Nominal 
Balance of the Bonds (ﬁ
Nominal Interest Rate
ﬂ). The interest of the Bonds, whatever 
their Class, will be payable at the end of 
each Interest Accrual Period on each Payment 
Date.  For interest accrual purposes, the Bonds issue 
will be divided into successive interest 
accrual periods that will include the days
 elapsed between two consecutive Payment 
Dates (including the initial Payment Date and 
excluding the final Payment Date (each one 
of these, an ﬁ
Interest Accrual Period
ﬂ). Exceptionally, the first Interest Accrual Period 
will commence on the Disbursement Date (incl
uding the latter), and will end on the first 
Payment Date (excluding the latter). 


 39 
The Nominal Interest Rate accrued by each 
Series of Bonds during each Interest Accrual 
Period will be the result of adding (i) the Re
ference Interest Rate, as defined below, 
which is common to all the Series of Bonds, and rounded to the nearest thousandth, 

taking into account that, in the event of equa
l conditions for rounding up or down, the 
amount will always be rounded up; plus (ii) 
the margin applicable to each Series of 
Bonds, as indicated below.  
Reference Interest Rate 
The Reference Interest Rate for fixing the inter
est rate applicable to the Bonds of all the 
Classes will be the three (3) month EURIBOR inte
rest rate or, if necessary, its substitute 
(the ﬁReference Interest Rate
ﬂ), determined as stated below. 
Fixing of the Bond Reference Interest Rate 
The EURIBOR will be fixed according to the rules established in this section. On each of the Interest Rate Fixing Dates, (
as such term is defined below), the Sociedad 
Gestora, with the information received from the Financial Agent, will fix the Reference 

Interest Rate, which will be equa
l to the EURIBOR, as follows:  
(i) The three-month EURIBOR displayed on the EURIBOR01 page of the REUTERS 
screen, on the Fixing Date at 11.00 a.m. (CET). ﬁREUTERS screen, page 

EURIBOR01ﬂ is the one that displays th
e contents of the page ﬁEURIBOR01ﬂ in 
the REUTERS MONITOR MONEY RATES SERVICE (or any other page that 
may replace it in this service). 
(ii) In the absence of rates as indicated in num
ber (i) supra, the simple arithmetic mean 
of London interbank rates for non transfer
able deposits in euros, with three (3) 
month maturity, for an amount equivalent 
to the Receivable Nominal Balance of 
the Bonds on the Fixing Date by the entiti
es mentioned below, after and at about 
11.00 a.m. (CET) will prevail. This inter
est rate will be requested simultaneously 
from the following entities: 
- Banco Santander Central Hispano (London) 

- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (London) 

- Barclays Bank (London) 
- Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (London Branch) 
In the event that one or several of the aforementioned institutions do not furnish a 
list of quoted rates, the rate applied will 
be the rate that results from applying the 
simple arithmetic mean of the rates declar
ed by at least two (2) of the remaining 
institutions.  (iii) In the absence of the rates in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (i) and 
(ii), the Reference Interest Rate for the immediately previous Interest Accrual 

Period will apply. On the First Interest Fi
xing Date, in the event that the Reference 


 40 
Rate is not published in accordance with th
e provisions of sections (i) and (ii) 
supra, the rate applied, in accordance with
 the provisions of section (i), will be the 
rate published on the last Business Date on 
which such Reference Interest Rate was 
published.  
The Sociedad Gestora will k
eep copies of the REUTERS screen printouts, or if 
appropriate, the quote statements from the ba
nks referred to in section (ii) above, as 
documents accrediting the EU
RIBOR rate determined.  
Notwithstanding the above, the Reference Inte
rest Rate for the first Interest Accrual 
Period, in other words, the period between th
e Disbursement Date and the first Payment 
Date, will be the result of the linear inter
polation between the four (4) month EURIBOR 
rate and the three (5) month EURIBOR rate, 
taking into account the number of days of 
the first Interest Accrual Period. The Interest 
Rate for the first Interest Accrual Period will 
be calculated with the following formula: 
R = Ec + (d-t1)/t2*(El-Ec) 
Where 
R= Reference Interest Rate for th
e first Interest Accrual Period. 
d = Number of days of the first Interest Accrual Period (127). 

Ec = four (4) month EURIBOR rate.  
El = five (5) month EURIBOR rate.  
t1 = Number of true days included in the short Euribor index period (124). 

t2 = Number of true days included between short Euribor index period and the long 
Euribor index period (29). 
The four (4) month EURIBOR rate and the five (5) month EURIBOR rate for the first 
Interest Accrual Period will be fixed in acco
rdance with the rul
es established in the 
previous paragraphs of this section.  
Reference Interest Rate Fixing Date 
The Reference Interest Rate fixing date for each Interest Accrual Period will be the 
second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Payment Date (the "
Fixing Date
") and will apply 
for the next Interest Accrual Period. Exceptiona
lly, for the first Interest Accrual Period, 
the Reference Rate will be fixed on the second (2
nd) Business Day prior to the 
Disbursement Date (that is to say, 16 July 2007). 
Once the Bond Reference Interest Rate has been
 fixed, and on the same Fixing Date, the 
Sociedad Gestora will calculate and fix, for each
 of the Series of Bonds, the interest rate 
applicable to the next Interest Accrual Period. 
 

 41 
 Margin applicable to the Reference Int
erest Rate for each Series of Bonds  
The margin applicable to the Reference In
terest Rate fixed as specified above, for 
calculating the interest rate accrued by the B
onds of each Series in each Interest Accrual 
Period, will have the following ceiling: 
-  Series A1 Bonds: up to 0.1%, inclusive.  

- Series A2 Bonds: up to 0.21%, inclusive. 
- Series A3 Bonds: up to 0.24%, inclusive. 
- Series B Bonds: up to 0.30%, inclusive. 
- Series C Bonds: up to 0.35%, inclusive. 

- Series D Bonds: up to 0.60%, inclusive. 

- Series E Bonds: up to 2.10%, inclusive. 
The margin applicable to each Class of Bonds
, expressed as a percentage, will be fixed by 
agreement between the Arranger and the 
Underwriting and Placement Agents at the latest before 12.00 noon 
(CET) of the second (2
 nd) Business Day 
before the Date 
of Disbursement. 
The definitive margin of the Bonds will be notified by fa
x by the Arranger to the 
Sociedad Gestora before 1.00 p.m. (CET) of that same day. In 
the event of the absence of 
this notification, the Sociedad Gestora will set the ma
rgin for those Series of Bonds as: - Series A1 Bonds: 0.09% 
- Series A2 Bonds: 0.16% 

- Series A3 Bonds: 0.21% 

- Series B Bonds: 0.25% 

- Series C Bonds: 0.30% 
- Series D Bonds: 0.50% 
- Series E Bonds: 1.80% 

At the same time the Sociedad Gestora will also notify the CNMV of the definitive 
margins applicable, which will be registered in the disbursement certificate. 
 Formulae for calculating the interest  of the Bonds 
The Sociedad Gestora will calculate the interest accrued by each Bond, during each 
Interest Accrual Period, in accord
ance with the following formula: 


 42 
360**iiiinrNI where: 
Ii Total amount of interest accrued by the Bond in the Interest Accrual Period.
 Ni  Receivable Nominal Balance of the Bond at th
e start of the Interest Accrual Period. 
ri Nominal Interest Rate on an annual basis,
 calculated as the sum of the Reference 
Interest Rate of the pertinent Interest 
Accrual Period plus the specified margin.
  ni is the number of days in the Interest Accrual Period. 
4.8.1 Interest payment and principal reimbursement dates 
Interest on the Bonds, regardless of the Series to which they belong, will be paid by 
quarters in arrears, on the 22
nd day of February, May, August and November of each year 
until the total maturity of the Bonds. If any 
of these days is not a Business Day, the 
interest and principal for that quarter (excep
t for the first Payment Date, which will be the 
interest and principal for the time elapsed between the Disbursement Date and the first 

Payment Date) will be paid the next 
Business Day (each of these dates, a ﬁ
Payment 
Dateﬂ). The first Payment Date 
will be 22 November 2007. 
For the purposes of this Prospectus, business days (ﬁ
Business Days
ﬂ) are all those days 
that are not non-business days on the TARG
ET (Trans European Automated Real-Time 
Gross Settlement Express Transfer System) calendar. 
In the event that on a Payment Date, and 
despite the mechanisms
 established for the 
protection of the rights of the Bondholders, the Available Funds, as the latter are defined 

in section 3.4.6.2 of the Additional Building Bloc
k, are not sufficient to pay all or part of 
the interest accrued by the Bonds of any of
 the Classes, pursuant to the Priority of 
Payment Order or the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order set forth in such sections 
and in the event that the Available Funds onl
y suffice to partially meet obligations that 
rank in the same order of priority, the 
amount will be distributed among the Bonds 
involved, in proportion to the Receivable Nomi
nal Balance thereof, and any amounts that 
the Bondholders have not been paid will be pa
id on the next Payment Date that this is 
possible, without accruing default interest. 
Any payments not made to the Bondholders 
will be made on the next Payment Date on wh
ich sufficient Available Funds exist to do 
so, ranking immediately prior to the payments to
 the holders of Bonds of that same Series 
corresponding to that period. The Fund, acting through its Sociedad Gestora, will not 

postpone the payment of interest or principa
l of the Bonds later than their corresponding 
Legal Maturity Date.  Any current or future withholdings, rates and ta
xes to which the capital, interest or yields 
of the Bonds are subject will be for the 
sole account of their holders and, where 
applicable, their corresponding amount will be de
ducted by the entity obliged to do so in 
the legally established manner. 

 43 
Payment will be made through CAJA MADRID
, using IBERCLEAR and its participative 
entities to distribute the amounts.  
4.8.2 Calculation Agent The agent responsible for calculating the B
ond interest will be the Sociedad Gestora. 
4.9. Bond maturity and redemption dates 4.9.1 Redemption price The Bonds will be redeemed at 100% of thei
r face value, that is to say, one hundred 
thousand (100,000) euros per Bond, free of costs and taxes for the Bondholder.  
4.9.2 Redemption Date 
The Bond redemption dates will be the Payment 
Dates. The first Payment Date will be 22 
November 2007. 
4.9.3 Ordinary rules regarding redemption of 
the  Class A, B, C, D and E Bonds The redemption of the Class A Bonds will co
mmence on the first Payment Date with the 
partial redemption of the Series A1 Bonds. Th
e first Payment Date on which the partial 
redemption of the Series A2 B
onds will take place will be 
the Payment Date on which the 
Series A1 Bonds are redeemed in full, except 
in the event described in section 4.9.4 of 
this Securities Note.  The first Payment Da
te on which the partial redemption of the 
Series A3 Bonds will take place will be the 
Payment Date on which the Series A2 Bonds 
are redeemed in full, except in the event describ
ed in section 4.9.4 of this Securities Note.  
The redemption of the Class B Bonds will only commence when the Class A Bonds have 
been redeemed in full, excep
t in the case described in section 4.9.4 of this Securities 
Note. The redemption of the Class C Bonds will only commence when the Class A and B 
Bonds have been redeemed in full, except in
 the case described in section 4.9.4 of this 
Securities Note. 
The redemption of the Class D Bonds will only commence when the Class A, B and C 
Bonds have been redeemed in full, except in
 the case described in section 4.9.4 of this 
Securities Note. 
The redemption of the Class E Bonds will onl
y commence when the Class A, B, C and D 
Bonds have been redeemed in full, except in
 the case described in section 4.9.4 of this 
Securities Note.  
The redemption of the Class A, B, C, D 
and E Bonds will be conducted on a pro rata 
basis among the Bonds of the same Class 
that are scheduled for redemption on each 
Payment Date (as provided for below), by 
reducing the nominal amount, until it has been 
completed.  


 44 
The Class A, B, C, D and E Bonds will be
 redeemed on each Payment Date with the 
Available Funds, by an amount equivalent to the lesser of the following amounts (the 
ﬁAmount Available for Redemption
ﬂ):  
(a) The positive difference on that Payment Date between (i) the Receivable Nominal 
Balance of the Class A, B, C, D and E Bonds before the amount redeemed on that 

Payment Date, and (ii) the Receivable 
Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted 
Certificates for the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior to the 
month of the Payment Date in question; and 
(b) The Available Funds on that Payment Da
te, after deducting the amounts of items 
(1) to (8) in the Priority of Payment Order.   
Consequently, in the event of Certificates w
hose Mortgage Loans are six (6) months or 
more in arrears, or that, being less than six 
months in arrears, have been declared in 
default by the Seller (the ﬁ
Defaulted Certificates
ﬂ) in the three (3) Calculation Periods 
immediately prior to the Payment Date in ques
tion, (except for the first Payment Date, on 
which the four (4) first Calculation Periods w
ill be considered), the Class A, B, C, D and 
E Bonds will be redeemed by an amount equa
l to their Outstanding Nominal Balance of 
such Defaulted Certificates on the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior to 

the current Payment Date, plus the amounts due and uncollected in the three (3) 
Calculation Periods immediately prior to the 
Payment Date in question  (except for the 
first Payment Date, on which the four (4) firs
t Calculation Periods will be considered). 
The Bonds will be redeemed using the Av
ailable Funds, always after paying any 
obligations that rank before the redemption 
in the Priority of Payment Order or the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. Shoul
d there be Available Funds for making these 
payments, the corresponding amounts will remain pending redemption until the 
immediately next Payment Date on which th
ere are Available Funds for making them. 
Should it not be possible to substitute the Certificates, as stipulated in section 2.2.9 of the 
Additional Building Block, the proceeds of th
e early redemption, by the Seller, of the 
Certificates in question, will be applied to redemption of the Class A, B, C, D and E 

Bonds on the next Payment Date, subject to the Priority of Payment Order or to the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order.  
4.9.4 Extraordinary rules for pro rata redempt
ion  of the Class A, B, C, D and E 
Bonds Notwithstanding the ordinary rules for the 
redemption of the Class A, B, C, D and E 
Bonds set forth in section 4.9.3 of this 
Securities Note, the Amount Available for 
Redemption will be distributed pro rata between 
the Classes A, B, C, D and/or E, in terms 
of the proportion that the Receivable Nominal Balance of each Class represents with 

regard to the Receivable Nominal Balance of
 the Classes A, B, C, D and E, whenever, 
prior to the corresponding Payment Da
te, the following circumstances exist:  
(1) To proceed to the redemption of Class B:

3.70% of the sum of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Classes A, B, C, 
D and E,  


 45 
(ii) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted Certificates, more 
than 90 days in arrears, is less than 2.00% of the Receivable Nominal 
Balance of the Non-Defaulted Certificates pooled in the Fund, both items 

being measured on the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior 

to the Payment Date in question; 
(iii) the Reserve Fund Required on the Payment Date in question has been fully 
funded; and 
(iv) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Certificates on the last day of the 
Calculation Period immediately prior to the Payment Date in question is 

greater than or equal to 10% of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the 

Certificates on the Date of Incorporation.  
(2) To proceed to the redemption of Class C:  
(i)      the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Class C is equal to or greater than 
6.00% of the sum of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Classes A, B, C, 
D and E,  
(ii) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Non-Defaulted Certificates, more 
than 90 days in arrears, is less than 1.75% of the Receivable Nominal 

Balance of the Non-Defaulted Certificates pooled in the Fund, both items 
being measured on the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior 
to the Payment Date in question; 
(iii) the Reserve Fund Required on the Payment Date in question has been fully 
funded; and 
(iv) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Certificates on the last day of the 
Calculation Period immediately prior to the Payment Date in question is

Certificates on the Date of Incorporation.  
(3) To proceed to the redemption of Class D:  
(i)      the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Class D is equal to or greater than 
4.80% of the sum of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Classes A, B, C,

than 90 days in arrears, is less than 1.50% of the Receivable Nominal 

Balance of the Non-Defaulted Certificates pooled in the Fund, both items 

being measured on the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior 
to the Payment Date in question; 
(iii) the Reserve Fund Required on the Payment Date in question has been fully 
funded; and 


 46 
(iv) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Certificates on the last day of the 
Calculation Period immediately prior to the Payment Date in question is 
greater than or equal to 10% of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the 

Certificates on the Date of Incorporation.  
(4) To proceed to the redemption of Class E:   
(i)      the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Class E is equal to or greater than 
3.50% of the sum of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Classes A, B, C,

being measured on the last day of the Calculation Period immediately prior 
to the Payment Date in question; 
(iii) the Reserve Fund Required on the Payment Date in question has been fully 
funded; and 
(iv) the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Certificates on the last day of the 
Calculation Period immediately prior to the Payment Date in question is 

greater than or equal to 10% of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the 
Certificates on the Date of Incorporation.  
The Series A1 Bonds, the Series A2 Bonds a
nd the Series A3 Bonds will be redeemed on 
a pro rata basis if, on a Payment Date, the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Defaulted 

Certificates, exceeds 25% of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Certificates on the 

Date of Incorporation.  
In such an event, the Amount Available for 
Redemption will be distributed pro rata in 
terms of the proportion represented by the Re
ceivable Nominal Balance of each Series. 
4.9.5 Collection Dates, Collection P
eriods and Notification Dates ﬁCollection Dateﬂ, will be each of the dates on which that the Seller, as servicer of the 
Mortgage Loans, will pay the amounts recei
ved from such Mortgage Loans into the 
Treasury Account. CAJA MADRID will make its payments every Tuesday or, if it is not 
a Business Day, the transfer will be made 
on the immediately next Business Day, unless 
the payment intervals are modified in accord
ance with section 3.4.5.1 of the Additional 
Building Block.  
ﬁCalculation Dateﬂ
 will mean the 20
th day of each month, or if this is not a Business 
Day, the immediately previous Business Day,
 when the Sociedad Gestora will calculate 
the amount that the Seller should have delivered to it as the amounts received from the 
Mortgage Loans during the previous Calculation Period.  The first calculation date will be 
20 August 2007.  
ﬁCalculation Periodﬂ
, will mean a period that coincides with a calendar month. 
Exceptionally the first Calculation Period will commence on the Date of Incorporation 


 47 
and will end on the last day of the month of Ju
ly 2007, while the last Calculation Period 
will commence on the first day of the month 
on which the Fund is liquidated and the 
Payment Date on which that liquidation takes place.  
ﬁNotification Date
ﬂ, will mean the second (2
nd) Business Day before each Payment Date 
throughout the life of the Fund. On these dates, the Sociedad Gestora will notify the 

amounts of principal and interest payable to the Bondholders, in the manner described in 

section 4.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
4.9.6 Early Redemption of the Bonds 
Notwithstanding the obligation of the Fund, through its Sociedad Gestora, to redeem the 
Bonds of each Series on the Legal Maturity
 Date or the partial redemptions on each 
Payment Date, as established in the previous
 sections, the Sociedad Gestora will be 
authorised to proceed with the early li
quidation of the Fund and hence the early 
redemption on a Payment Date, of the entire bond 
issue, in accordance with the events of 
early liquidation and the requirements set forth in section 4.4.3 of the Registration 

Document and subject to the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. 
4.10. Indication of the yield  The main characteristic of the Bonds is th
at their periodic redemption depends on the 
aggregate behaviour of the Mortgage Loans. 
The average life, yield, duration and final ma
turity of the Bonds of each Series depends 
on diverse factors, the most significant of which are as follows: 
a) The redemption system and calendar for each of the Mortgage Loans established in 
the pertinent deeds or in the additional do
cumentation furnished in relation thereto, 
if subsequently amended by ag
reement between the parties. 
b) The capacity of the Mortgagors to prepay
, in full or in part, the Mortgage Loans 
and the speed at which such early redemp
tion takes place in aggregate over the life 
of the Fund. 
c) The floating interest rates that will a
pply to each of the Mortgage Loans, which 
will cause the amount of each repayment instalment to vary. 
d) Arrears of the Mortgagors in making the Mortgage Loan repayments. 
In this regard, early redemptions of the Mortgage Loans by the Mortgagors are very 
significant. The early redemptions are subject to
 continuous change and 
in this Prospectus 
are estimated using several assumptions for the future behaviour of the constant annual 

early redemption rate (ﬁ
ERRﬂ). This will have a direct bearing on the velocity at which 
the Bonds are redeemed and hence on their average life and duration. 
To calculate the data shown in the tables cont
ained in this section, and in view of the 
uncertain nature of many of the paramete
rs, the following hypotheses have been assumed: 


 48 
1. The Nominal Interest Rates applicable 
to the Series A1, A2, A3, B, C, D and E 
Bonds, taking into account the three (3) mont
h EURIBOR on 8 June 2007, that is to say, 
4.176%, and supposing that the definitive margin 
applicable is set as 0.07% for the Series 
A1 Bonds, 0.14% for the Series A2 Bonds, 0.19% for the Series A3 Bonds, 0.25% for the 

Class B Bonds, 0.30% for the Class C Bonds
, 0.50% for the Class D Bonds and 1.80% 
for the Class E Bonds.  
  Taking into account that, on the first Payment 
Date, the Reference Interest Rate will be 
the rate that results from the linear inter
polation between the four (4) month EURIBOR 
rate and the five (5) month EURIBOR rate, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 4.8 of 
this Securities Note, and since the four (4) 
month and five (5) month EURIBOR rate on 8 
June 2007 are 4.226% and 4.265%, respectively 
and, therefore the interpolated Euribor is 
4.230%, the Nominal Rate of Interest applicab
le to the Bonds of each Series on the first 
Payment Date would be as follows: 
  2. Weighted average interest rate of 
the Bonds: 4.353%, which has been obtained 
using the three (3) month EURIBOR of 2 July 2007. 
3. Arrears of more than thirty (30) days 
of the Certificates portfolio, with a recovery 
period of six (6) months: 0.60% per annum. 
4. Defaulted items of the Certificates por
tfolio: 0.30% per annum from January 2008, 
with 85% of the stock of NPLs
 recovered one year later. 
5. That the Bond Disbursement Date will be 18 July 2007.  
6. The Sociedad Gestora will 
exercise the option relating to the early liquidation and 
early redemption of the Bond issue, when the sum of the Receivable Nominal 

Balance of the Mortgage Loans on the last
 day of the Calculation Period prior to 
the Payment Date in question is less th
an 10% of the sum of the Receivable 
Nominal Balance on the Date of Incorporation. 
7. The expenses that the Fund must 
meet have been estimated as follows: 
7,510,773.66 euros as Initial Expenses, 
350,000 euros per annum as Ordinary 
Expenses, 10,000 euros as Liquidation E
xpenses and no Extraordinary Expenses 
have been considered. For these purposes,
 Initial Expenses, Ordinary Expenses, 
Extraordinary Expenses and Liquidation Expenses will have meaning attributed to 
them in section 3.4.6.5 of th
e Additional Building Block.

NOTE FOR THE INVESTOR: 
The Sociedad Gestora declares th
at the information in the charts displayed below is only 
given by way of example, and the amounts do not represent a specific obligation by the 
Fund to make payments to third parties on th
e respective dates or in the periods to which 
they refer. The figures have been drawn up 
on the hypothesis that the loan default and 
repayment rates remain constant throughout the 
life of the Fund yet are actually subject to 
constant change.  Therefore any investor in
terested in knowing the payments that the 
Fund is scheduled to make on each specific da
te must request the pertinent information 
from the institutions authorized to distribut
e it, Sociedad Gestora, AIAF Market and 
CNMV. Nevertheless, the information can al
so be requested through the Underwriting 
Agents and other entities that operate on the secondary market.

5. ADMISSION TO TRADING AND DEALING ARRANGEMENTS 
5.1. Market where the Bonds will be traded The Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of 
the Fund, will apply to have this Bond issue 
admitted to official trading, once the Fund 
has been incorporated and Disbursement has taken place, on the AIAF Fixed Income Market (ﬁ
AIAF
ﬂ) so that the Bonds can be traded 
no later than one (1) month after the Disbursement Date.  
If the Sociedad Gestora fails to have the B
onds admitted to trading in the aforementioned 
time frame, it will notify the CNMV accordingl
y and publish, in a nationwide newspaper, 
both the reasons for such failure and the new date on which the Bonds are scheduled to be 
admitted to trading, without prejudice to the 
possibility for the Sociedad Gestora to be 
held contractually liable if the 
failure is attributable to it. Moreover, the Sociedad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund,  will request the inclusion 

of the Bonds in the accounting register managed by IBERCLEAR, so that they are 

cleared and settled in accordance with the 
operating rules applicable to AIAF-listed 
Bonds established, or to be approve
d in the future by IBERCLEAR. 
The Sociedad Gestora hereby declares that it knows the requirements and conditions 

necessary for listing, quotation and delisti
ng of Bonds in the AIAF according to the 
applicable laws and the requirements of its 
ruling body and agrees to comply with the 
same. 
  

 61 
5.2. Financial Agent and Depository Agent  The payment of interest and principal for the 
Bond issue referred to in this Securities 
Note will be handled by CAJA MADRID, wh
ich has the resources to carry out this 
function. 
The interest and/or the principal of the B
onds of each Series will be paid until the final 
redemption thereof in Interest Accrual Periods in arrears, on each of the Payment Dates, 
in accordance with the conditions set forth in sections 4.8 and 4.9 supra of this Securities 
Note. The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and for the account of the Fund, will enter, with 
CAJA MADRID into a contract that regulates 
the deposit of the Certificates, the Treasury 
Account and the financial servicing of the Bond issue (
ﬁFinancial Services Contractﬂ
). The obligations to be assumed by CAJA MA
DRID as paying agent under this Financial 
Services Contract are as summarised below: 
(i) On the Disbursement Date, and following inst
ructions of the Sociedad Gestora, pay 
to each of the Underwriting and Placement Agents the amount
 of the underwritingand distribution fee owing to each of them, unless they have deducted such fee 
upon delivering the 
underwritten amount. 
(ii) Make the Bond interest and redemption payments, and any others to the pertinent 
entities, on the corresponding Payment Date, after receiving appropriate 
instructions from the Sociedad Gestora. 
(iii) On each of the Fixing Dates, notify the Soci
edad Gestora of the Reference Interest 
Rate that will serve as the basis for calculating the Nominal Interest Rate 
applicable to  each Series of the Bonds fo
r each pertinent Interest Accrual Period. Furthermore, Caja Madrid will act as the depos
itory of the Multiple Certificate and of the 
Treasury Account. 
The Financial Services Contract will terminat
e on the date that the Fund is liquidated. 
The Sociedad Gestora is authorised to substitute
 the Financial Agent (in all or some of its 
duties as the servicer of the Treasury Account
, paying agency or depository of the 
Multiple Certificate), provided that this is 
permitted under current law and, if and when 
necessary, the authorisation of the competen
t authorities is obtained. The grounds that 
give rise to the substitution must be a serious 
breach of its obligations who be liable to 
harm the interests of the Bondholders. The substitution will be repor
ted to the CNMV, the Rating Agencies and the Seller, and the subs
tituted Financial Agent must bear all the 
costs incurred in such substitution. 
Financial Agent rating change events For the purposes of complying with the Criteria of Fitch, Moody™s and S&P, the 
Financial Agent will give an irrevocable unde
rtaking to notify the 
Sociedad Gestora, as soon as such circumstance occurs, throughout th
e life of the Bond Issue, if the ratings 


 62 
assigned to its long and short term non-subor
dinated and unsecured debt by the Rating 
Agencies are modified, withdrawn or suspended. 
Fitch's and Moody™s Criteria
 In the event that the rating of the Fina
ncial Agent™s non-subordinated and unsecured 
short-term debt is downgraded below F1 (Fitch)
 or P-1 (Moody™s), within the thirty (30) 
days following such downgrading the Sociedad 
Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, and after 
notifying these Rating Agencies, will put into practice one of the options that are 
described below and are necessary, to permit an
 appropriate level of collateralisation to 
be maintained with respect to the commitmen
ts derived from the duties set forth in the 
Financial Services Contract: 
(i) Obtain from the Financial Agent, issued 
by a credit institution with a rating equal 
to or higher than F1 (Fitch) and P-1 (Mood
y™s), or another explicitly recognised by 
these Rating Agencies, an unconditional fi
rst demand bank guarantee and waiving 
the benefit of surety, to guarantee the 
obligations of Financial Agent under the 
Financial Services Contract, or else 
(ii) Substitute the Financial Agent with a
nother credit institution with a minimum 
rating of F1 (Fitch) and P-1 (Moody™s), or
 another explicitly recognised by these 
Rating Agencies, contracting the maximum yield possible for the balances of the 
Treasury Account. 
(iii) Should options (i) and (ii) above not be 
possible, obtain from the Financial Agent 
or from a third party, collateral security 
in favour of the Fund on financial assets 
rated P-1 (Moody™s). In the case of Fitch, th
e rating must be equal to or higher than 
F1 if the assets mature in or in less than th
irty (30) days, or equal to or higher than 
F1+ if the assets mature in or in more 
than thirty (30) days. In any case, the 
collateral must be for an amount sufficien
t to guarantee the commitments set forth 
in the Financial Services Contract.  
S&P™s criteria Moreover, according to the update
d S&P counterparty criterion ﬁ
Revised Framework For 
Applying Counterparty And Supporting Party Criteria
ﬂ published on 8 May 2007, should 
the rating of the Financial Agent be downgrad
ed, at any moment throughout the lifetime 
of the Bond issue, to A-2 (S&P), it will b
ecome a Financial Agent ineligible for the 
transaction and must, within a  maximum of sixty (60) Business Days: 
(iii) Substitute the ineligible Financial Ag
ent with another credit institution with a 
rating of at least A-1 (S&P), or else 
(ii) Obtain from a financial institution deemed
 appropriate by S&P, with a rating of at 
least A-1 (S&P), a first demand bank guarantee to guarantee the obligations of the 

ineligible Financial Agent under the Financial Services Contract.  
(iii) Moreover, if the preceding options (i) and (ii) are not possible in the terms 
stipulated, invest the balances in short-term
 fixed interest assets in euros issued by 


 63 
financial institutions whose short-term debt is 
rated at least A-1 (S&P), for periods of less 
than sixty (60) Business Days (always maturing before the next Bond Payment Date). 
The balances may be invested for periods of 
more than sixty (60) Business Days and less 
than as determined by the next Bond Payment 
Date provided that a clause is included that 
stipulates that such investment must be cancelled within a maximum of sixty (60) 

Business Days of the rating being downgraded. 
Any replacement, guarantee or investment will 
be subject to confirmation of the Bond 
rating by S&P. All the costs incurred in any 
of the actions defined above will be for the 
account of the ineligible counterparty. 
6. EXPENSE OF THE ADMISSION TO TRADING 
The Initial Expenses will be paid with th
e amount of the first drawdown of the 
Subordinated Loan, as detailed in section 3.4.3.2 
of the Additional Building Block. In this

 7. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
7.1. Statement of the capacity in which the 
advisors involved in the issue that are 
mentioned in the Securities Note have acted 
1. The financial structure of the Fund and th
e Bond issue has been arranged by CAJA 
MADRID. 
2. Uría Menéndez y Cia., Abogados, S.C., as independent advisor, has acted as the 
legal advisor on the incorporation of the 
Fund and the issue of the Bonds and has 
reviewed the representations relative to th
e tax treatment of the Bonds and of the 
Fund that are set forth in section 4.5.1 of the Registration Document. 
7.2. Other information in the Securities Note 
that has been audited or reviewed by the 
auditors Not applicable. 7.3. Statements or reports attributed to a person as an expert 
KPMG is acting as auditor for the verification of a series of attributes of the selection of 
mortgage loans owned by CAJA MADRID 
from which the Mortgage Loans will be 
extracted in order to issue the Certificates
 that will be subscribed by the Fund upon 
incorporation. 7.4. Information sourced from third parties 
As part of the tasks involved in checking the information contained in this Prospectus, the 
Sociedad Gestora has received confirmation from CAJA MADRID that the information 

about CAJA MADRID, the Mortgage Loans and the Certificates that is given in section 

2.2.8 of the Additional Building Block is true, 
and that the rest of the information about 
CAJA MADRID, the Mortgage Loans and the Certificates that is contained in this 
Prospectus is also true. In the Deed of In
corporation of the Fund, CAJA MADRID will 
repeat to the Sociedad Gest
ora that such information remains true on the Date of 
Incorporation. The Sociedad Gestora confirms that it has ac
curately reproduced the information that it 
has received from CAJA MADRID and, 
insofar as it knows and can tell from such 
information received from CAJA MADRID, confirms that it has not omitted any fact that 
might result in the information reproduced bei
ng inaccurate or misleading, nor does this 
Prospectus omit material facts or data that could be significant for the investor. 
7.5. Credit ratings assigned 
by the Rating Agencies 
The Bonds included in this Securities Note have
 been assigned, prior to the registration of 
this Prospectus, the following ratings by the Rating Agencies. 
 

 65 
 Bonds  
S&P Fitch 
Moody™s 
A1 Bonds 
AAA AAA Aaa 
A2 Bonds 
AAA AAA Aaa 
A3 Bonds 
AAA AAA Aaa 
Class B Bonds AA AA Aa2 
Class C Bonds A A A2 
Class D Bonds BBB BBB Baa2 
Class E Bonds BB BB Ba3 
 The ratings assigned by S&P measure the capacity of the Fund to timely pay interest on 
each scheduled Payment Date and repay the pr
incipal throughout the transaction and, in 
any event, before the Legal Maturity Date. 
The ratings awarded by Fitch are an opinion of about the capacity of the Fund to timely 
pay interest throughout the transaction and repa
y the principal before the Legal Maturity 
Date, in accordance with the conditions sti
pulated in Prospectus. According to the 
Prospectus, the payment of interest of the Se
ries B, C, D and E Bonds will be deferred in 
certain circumstances. This means that inter
est might not be received in respect of these 
Bonds during a certain period of time if th
e delay trigger is reached, with such 
circumstance not being considered an ev
ent of default on payment of the Bonds. 
The ratings assigned by Moody™s measure the 
loss expected before the Legal Maturity 
Date. In Moody™s opinion, the structure permits 
the timely payment of the interest and the 
payment of the principal throughout the tran
saction and, in any case, before the Fund's 
Legal Maturity Date. The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies 
do not constitute an 
evaluation of the 
likelihood of the Mortgagors repaying capital ear
ly, or of the extent to which such early 
repayments differ from those originally est
imated. In no way do the ratings represent a 
rating of the level of actuarial yield. 
The assigned ratings, as well as any revision or suspension thereof: 
(i) are formulated by the Rating Agencies on 
the basis of varied information received, 
the accuracy and completeness of which is not guaranteed by the Rating Agencies, and 

therefore the Rating Agencies will in no event be
 held liable for the contents thereof; and 
(ii) do not constitute and, therefore, c
ould not in any way be interpreted as an 
invitation, recommendation or solicitation for i
nvestors to proceed to carry out any type 
of transaction with the Bonds and, in particul
ar, to acquire, retain, encumber or sell such 


 66 
Bonds. The final ratings may be revised, su
spended or withdrawn at any time by the 
Rating Agencies, depending on any information that comes to their knowledge. Such 
situations, which will not constitute events
 of early liquidation, will be notified 
immediately both to the CNMV and the Bondholders. 
To perform the rating and monitoring process,
 the Rating Agencies rely on the accuracy 
and completeness of the information that th
ey are given by the Seller, the Sociedad 
Gestora, the Arranger, the Aud
itors and the legal advisors. 
These credit ratings does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Bonds. The 
credit rating may be revised, suspended or w
ithdrawn at any time by the rating agency. 
These credit ratings are only an estimate a
nd do not necessarily mean that potential 
investors do not have to conduct their own analysis of the Bonds that they intend to buy. 
The Prospectus submitted for filing and registra
tion at the CNMV is exactly the same as 
the Prospectus delivered to the Rating Agencies. 
  

 67 
ADDITIONAL BUILDING BLOCK TO
 THE SECURITIES NOTE  (ANNEX VIII TO REGULATIONS 809/2004) 1. BONDS 
1.1. Minimum amount of the issue 
The mortgage transfer certificates that will 
be pooled in the Fund at the time of its 
incorporation will consist of an amount of 
principal valued at three thousand million 
(3,000,000,000) euros or slightly less (the ﬁ
Certificates
ﬂ). 
The Sociedad Gestora considers, taking into
 account the information about the loans of 
the audited portfolio facilitated by Caja Ma
drid, that on the Incorporation date, the 
Receivable Nominal Balance of such loans will be sufficient to pool in the Fund 

Certificates for the amount set forth in the previous paragraph.
 1.2. Confirmation that the information relating to an undertaking or obligor which is 
not involved in the issue has been accurately reproduced 
Not applicable. 2. UNDERLYING ASSETS 
2.1. Confirmation that the securitised assets 
have the capacity to produce the funds 
payable on the Bonds 
The Sociedad Gestora confirms that the Ce
rtificates will be backed by the Mortgage 
Loans, are of characteristics (amount, term, in
terest rate, mortgage guarantees, etc.) that 
demonstrate the capacity to produce funds to make the payment owed and payable on the 

Bonds, payments which will be made in accordan
ce with the Priority of Payment Order or 
the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order a
nd the subordination that exists between the 
different Classes.  
However, in order to consolidate its financ
ial structure and procure the largest possible 
coverage for the risks inherent to the issue, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, 

will proceed on the same date as on which it 
grants the Deed of Incorporation, to 
formalise the contracts and carry out the actions 
that are stipulated in section 3.4.2 of this 
Additional Building Block.  
Also, since not all of the Bonds are subject to the same risk of default, the Rating 
Agencies have assigned each of the Classes  
the provisional solvency ratings set forth in 
section 7.5 of the Securities Note.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sociedad Gestora, after notifying the CNMV, will be 
authorised to proceed to the early liquidation of the Fund and hence the early redemption 

in the events and with the requirements set
 forth in section 4.4.3 of the Registration 
Document. 


 68 
The Sociedad Gestora gives the information set
 forth in the previous paragraphs on the 
basis of the representations made by the Seller 
with respect to the Credit Rights, that are 
listed in section 2.2.8 of the Additional Buildi
ng Block, of all the information supplied by 
the Seller about each mortgage loan liable to 
be sold, of the Audit Report, and of the 
valuation arising from the provisional rati
ngs assigned to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies.  
2.2. Assets backing the issue 
The Certificates constituting the Fund assets w
ill only be credit rights owned by CAJA 
MADRID, derived from mortgage loans gran
ted by CAJA MADRID to individuals, 
secured by first-class mortgages raised on fini
shed property located in Spanish territory 
valued by a valuation company, whose au
thorisation has been subject to Spanish 
legislation for an amount of  three thousand 
million (3,000,000,000) euros or slightly less 
(the ﬁMortgage Loansﬂ).  The Mortgage Loans will be transferred by 
the CAJA MADRID to the Fund by issuing 
Certificates in accordance with the individua
l characteristics of each Mortgage Loan. 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Certificates that CAJA MADRID will issue and the 
Fund will subscribe will be withdrawn from the 
loans in the portfolio audited as at 6 June 
2007, which consists of 17,733 mortgage lo
an with a Receivable 
Nominal Balance of 
Euros 3,288,190,061.43.  
KPMG, whose details are included in secti
on 5.2 of the Registration Document, has 
produced an audit report for 
the Sociedad Gestora regarding certain attributes of the 
Mortgage Loans from which Certificates are 
going to be issued for their pooling in the 
Fund, in order to comply with the provisions
 of article 5 of Royal Decree 926/1998 (the 
ﬁAudit Report
ﬂ).  This Audit Report addresses a series of quantitativ
e and qualitative attributes of the loans, 
in particular: purpose of the loans, identifica
tion of the borrowers, date signed, maturity 
date, reference interest rate, current interest 
rate, interest rate differential, initial amount 
of the loans, current balance of the loans, 
payment arrears, appraised value, current LTV 
value, address of the mortgaged property, mort
gage security, officially subsidised housing 
and transferability of the loans. 
This Audit Report has been based on a selecti
on of mortgage loans taken from the 17,733 
mortgage loans, with a Receivable Nominal Balance as at 6 June 2007 of Euros 

3,288,190,061.43, that form the audited portfolio, using sampling techniques, which are a 

generally accepted method for verifying an entity's records relating to a group of items 
(ﬁpopulationﬂ), and make it possible to draw
 a conclusion about that population through 
the analysis of a smaller number of items (ﬁsampleﬂ) than the total population. The 

confidence level indicates the probability that the actual number of items with deviations 

from a pattern existing in a population will not exceed a predefined limit (ﬁaccuracyﬂ).  
If the audit detects errors in any of th
e mortgage loans in the CAJA MADRID's 
portfolios, those loans will not be so
ld on the Date of Incorporation. 
 

 69 
2.2.1 Legal jurisdiction by which the pool of assets is governed 
The Certificates will be issued in acco
rdance with the laws of Spain.  2.2.2 General characteristics of the Mortgagors 
The Fund's assets will consist of the Certificat
es, which represent participations in loans 
granted for the acquisition of a finished dwelling located in Spanish territory, whose 

mortgagors are natural persons (the ﬁ
Mortgagorsﬂ), all of which are secured by a real 
estate mortgage duly registered at the Land Registry.   
The details of the most significant characteristics of the selected mortgage loans are 
described throughout section 2 of this Additional Building Block.  
The tables below show the distribution of the mortgage loans that make up the audited 
portfolio by maturity term date, contracted
 date, outstanding principal balance/appraised 
value ratio, reference rate, current  balance,
 current interest rate, reference rate and 
margin, geographical location, date of the ne
xt rate reset and default. These tables have 
been produced with information as at 6 June 2007.

2.2.3 Legal nature of the assets 
As indicated previously, all the assets will be 
Mortgage Loans that will be transferred to 
the Fund by CAJA MADRID through the issue of Certificates. 
Due to their characteristics, the Mortgage Lo
ans do not comply with all the requirements 
set forth in Section Two of "Ley del Mercado Hipotecarioﬂ and are transferred to the 

Fund through the issue of Certificates, in accordance with section 18 of Ley 44/2002.  
The Mortgage Loans have been granted before
 a notary public and registered at the Land 
Registry, and can be foreclo
sed in accordance with the provisions of Title IV of Book III 
of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento 1/2000, 
of 7 January (Civil Procedural Act). 
2.2.4 Dates in relation to the assets 
Each Mortgage Loan in the portfolio has a maturity date, without prejudice to the 
possibility of its early redemption, in accord
ance with the special terms and conditions 
stipulated in each one.  
At any time of the life of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgagors can redeem all or part of 
the outstanding capital early, and interest will 
cease to accrue on the early redeemed part 
from the date on which the repayment is made. 
Section 2.2.2 of this Additional Building Bloc
k contains a chart with the distribution of 
the Mortgage Loans according to their maturity 
term.  The last regular redemption date of 
the Mortgage Loans is 29 December 2046. 
2.2.5 Amount of the assets 
On the Date of Incorporation, the Outstandi
ng Nominal Balance of the Certificates will 
be three thousand million (3,000,000,000) euros,
 or slightly less, equivalent to the 
nominal amount of the Bond issue. The Certifi
cates that will be sold to the Fund will be 
withdrawn from the loans in the portfolio a
udited as at 6 June 2007, which consists of 
17,733 mortgage loans with a Receivable No
minal Balance of Euros 3,288,190,061.43. 
2.2.6 Level of overcollateralization 
The Fund is not overcollateralized, because th
e principal or total capital of Mortgage 
Loans that CAJA MADRID will sell to the F
und on the Date of Date of Incorporation 
will be equal to or slightly less than thr
ee thousand million (3,000,000,000) euros, which 
is the amount of the nominal value of the Bond issue.   
2.2.7 Asset creation method 
Pursuant to the criteria for granting of cred
its and loans secured by real estate mortgages 
to private individuals, the main Mortgage
 Loan granting criteria applied by CAJA 
MADRID, set forth in the Internal Memo on 
Granting of Mortgage Loans attached to the 
Deed of Incorporation, are as summarised below: 
 

 80 
1. Processing 
All mortgage loan application processes 
start with a first interview with the 
corresponding account manager, who conducts a 
preliminary analysis of the transaction 
and informs the customer of the possible ec
onomic terms and conditions of the loan, the 
documentation required to assess the transaction, estimated costs involved in the 

transaction, etc.  Any private individuals applying for a mortgage loan must furnish the following 
documents: 
 Documents identifying the parties involved 
(Identity Card, Resident's Card, etc.). 
 Documents to justify the income of the a
pplicant/s (if their salary is not paid 
directly into a CAJA MADRID account). 
 Documents to justify the investment. 
 Credit Transaction Applicationﬂ form signed by the applicant/s. 
 Credit Transaction-Private Individualsﬂ 
form, duly signed by the applicant/s. 
 Certificate of ownership and liens or si
mple note from the Land Registry, properly 
stamped and signed and not more than thirty days old (if the bank's Administrative 

Agency does not request this in
formation from the Registry). 
 Credit Transaction-Mortgage Securityﬂ 
form, duly signed by the applicant/s. 
After this first phase, the branch st
arts processing an electronic dossier. 
2. Risk assessment and authorisation system 
After the documentation required for the tr
ansaction has been collected, the economic 
terms and conditions of the loan
 have been agreed with the 
customer and the application 
forms have been filled in, Caja Madrid 
applies objective scoring systems to private 
individuals and microbusinesses, and rating systems to bodies corporate.  
These scoring and rating systems have been 
modelled in accordance with a segmentation 
of the Caja Madrid portfolio by type of cu
stomer and product, and serve to classify the 
transactions requested. Mortgage loans are 
subject to a specific scoring system, whose 
result is binding. 
In combination with the results of the scoring and rating systems, there is an authorisation 
system defined in the internal regulations, d
esigned for each type of product, that delimits 
the responsibilities of each decision-making body involved in the loan granting process, 

in an objective and recurrent manner. This aut
horisation system assigns different levels of 
responsibility to the different decision-making bodies in the loan-granting process in 

accordance with transaction size limits that va
ry in terms of the product in question. 

 81 
The decision-making body responsible for each
 transaction is assigned automatically by 
the scoring system. The procedure applied to ob
tain the decision-making level to be taken 
into account by the authorisation system is divided into the following stages: 
(i) Identify the segment to which the customer belongs. 
(ii) Identify the current outstanding risk. 
(iii) Check if there are any significant issues. 
(iv) Check if the customer on watch status. 
(v) Apply the result of the scoring models.  
(vi) Identify the decision-making body in line 
with the response, the specific procedure 
for each type of scoring model and the authorisation schedule. 
3. Approval and formalization of proposals 
The proposal approval process is computerised and handled via an electronic dossier in 
the CAJA MADRID sales netw
ork operating system called NOS, that will generate a 
report with all the information about th
e transaction and a recommendation. This 
document will serve as the basis for making a decision. 
After the decision-making committee has made 
a decision, an alert is generated in the 
branch office's agenda and bot
h the risk information and the customer record of the 
parties involved represent a snapshot of their position at that time.  
The committee can make the following decisions
: grant, grant with changes, review or 
refuse the loan. If the decision is ﬁgrant with changesﬂ, th
e committee will have modified the new terms 
and conditions, creating an economic proposal
 appendix, and also maintaining the 
original. The assigned committee is allowed to
 make the following changes: increase 
prices and/or fees and reduce amounts and terms. 
The branch then has the following options: 
a) If the decision is to accept the applicat
ion, the activities involved in arranging the 
loan and necessary to continue with the pro
cedure will be generated in the task list. b) If the decision is to refuse the application, the dossier is closed right away. 
c) If the decision is to review the appli
cation, the branch continues with the 
transaction by renegotiating it in the te
rms and conditions laid down by the 
decision making committee. This entails a modification/extension of collateral 

and/or a modification of the economic conditions. 


 82 
When the transaction has been approved, the 
branch checks that the terms and conditions 
recorded in the database match the ones actually
 approved. It is impossible to print any 
loan arrangement document until the ap
proval process has finished completely. 
The next phase is the loan arrangement ph
ase, for which purpose the loan arrangement 
fees are prepared, using a series of purpose-designed standard models, especially in more 

standard products such as residential mort
gages. Having these standard models ensures 
that mortgage proposals are consistent and minimizes the room for mistakes.  
4. Signing When the branch has obtained all the doc
uments required listed above, as well as any 
other specific documents needed for the transac
tion, it arranges a meeting with the parties 
involved for the signing of the loan arra
ngement documents and any other related 
documents. 
5. Debt collection management. Debt collection phases 
At CAJA MADRID, debt collection is handled 
on an integrated basis, taking into account 
all the positions of each customer. 
From the very first day that a payment is in
 arrears, every day the operating applications 
automatically check the account 
balances to see if they contain funds that can be used to 
pay off part or all of the amount owed and, if so, the funds are applied. 
During the first phase of the process, from the first day in arrears until day 45 (in other 
words, when the second instalment
 falls in arrears), the branch
 is responsible for handling 
the formalities. When 45 days have passed, and when instal
ments are 45 days overdue, the case is sent to 
a Telecollection Service for 92 days, which systematically calls the debtors to remind 
them about the outstanding debt.  
If the overdue amounts are paid during the Tele
collection phase, the case is returned to 
the branch office. Otherwise, in other words,
 if the debt remains unpaid for between 45 
and 92 days, the Telecollection phase will conti
nue and if it remains unpaid longer (more 
than 92 days), the case is automatically sen
t to the Debt Recovery Department, and 
otherwise (less than 45 days in arrear
s), it is sent back to the branch.  
However, the case may be sent to the Debt
 Recovery Department earlier both on account 
of the nature of the transaction and/or cu
stomer, and/or because the same customer has 
related transactions that have been in arrear
s for longer than the mortgage loan (in which 
case the Debt Recovery Department will start to handle the case even if the mortgage loan 

is only a minimum amount in arrears) but that indicates a situation that should be handled 
in a unified fashion. 
These time frames can also be changed, and the case be sent to Debt Recovery, in terms 
of the customer's profile. 

 83 
The main criteria applied by the Debt Recove
ry Department in the 
debt collection process are as follows: 
 Reach a friendly solution with the debtors th
at leads to the recovery of an amount 
larger than foreseeably would be obtained 
if foreclosure proceedings were initiated, 
and those solutions may include prepayment 
of the debt, dations in payment, partial 
arrangements with creditors (endeavouring, 
insofar as is possible, to avoid them 
affecting  the principal of the debt), and any other measure that implies an act of 

diligent servicing of the loan. 
 Unified treatment of all the positions of 
the same account holder or group, in any 
event giving preference to the maintenance 
of the mortgage security raised on the 
building and to the improvement of the re
payment conditions of the borrowers to 
avoid possible default. 
 Specialized management in line with natu
re of the account holder, collateral and 
amounts. 
 Segmentation of customers, to en
sure differentiated management. 
 Differentiation of Departments with obj
ectives and criteria adjusted to their 
respective portfolios, tailored to the regional scope of CAJA MADRID. 
 Support the Commercial Banking division by taking exclusive responsibility for 
debts when they have been in arrears for a given amount of time. 
 Maintain and supply internal debtor 
databases and notify authorised debtor 
registers (risk monitoring). 
 Even if the case has gone to court, try to reach a friendly agreement to avoid 
property repossessions and allow customers to
 pay off their debts, in the terms 
referred to in the first paragraph above. 
 Initiation of the lawsuit seeking payment on the unpaid mortgage transaction, 
without prejudice to reaching friendly debt collection agreements or negotiated 
withdrawal at any stage of the proceedings, adopting the procedural measures 

appropriate at each point in time, such as the decision to bid in auctions, the 

assignment of the auction, the award amount, withdrawal from lawsuit and similar.

In the exceptional event that, after the Date
 of Incorporation and, notwithstanding the 
declarations made by each Seller and the 
diligence exercised by th
e latter in ensuring 
their truthfulness, it is found, during life of the Fund, that one of the Certificates or that 

one of the Mortgage Loans upon which the latter have been issued, did not conform, on 

the Date of Incorporation, to the declarati
ons made in section 2.2.8 of this Additional 
Building Block or to the facts about which it st
ates, in such section, that it is not aware 
and set forth in the Deed of Incorporation, the Seller undertakes as follows: (A) To substitute the Certificate in questi
on with another of similar financial 
characteristics, in terms of the amount, 
residual term, class, interest rate, 
characteristics of the mortgagor and mortgaged property and Receivable Nominal 

Balance/Appraised Value ratio, that is a
ccepted by the Sociedad Gestora, reported 
to the Rating Agencies.  
The amounts accrued and unpaid until the date 
of substitution of the Certificate that 
is to be substituted, must be paid to 
the Fund by the Seller, in its capacity as 
servicer, at the time that such Certificate is substituted. 
Be that as it may, when substituting a Cer
tificate, the Seller must attest that the 
substitute Certificate conforms to the declar
ations set forth in section 2.2.8 of this 


 88 
Additional Building Block. The Sociedad G
estora will verify the suitability of the 
terms of the replacement Certificate. 
As soon as the Seller learns that one of the Ce
rtificates that it has issued or that one 
of the Mortgage Loans underlying them does not conform the aforementioned 

representations, it will report the matter to 
the Sociedad Gestora and, within five 
(5) days, indicate the mortgage loans with 
respect to which it intends to issue new 
mortgage transfer certificates to substitute the ones affected. If any Certificate is 
substituted, pursuant to the provisions of 
this paragraph, the Seller will proceed to 
shall deliver a new Multiple Certificate th
at will be exchanged for the certificate 
that is issued on the Date of Incorporation. The Seller undertakes to formalise the substitu
tion of  Certificates in an affidavit 
and in the manner and time frame stipulat
ed by the Sociedad Gestora, and to 
furnish any related information that th
e Sociedad Gestora deems necessary. The 
substitution will be reported to the Rating Ag
encies and a copy of the deed will be 
sent to the CNMV. 
(B) In addition to the obligation assumed in
 point (A) supra and whenever the 
substitution stipulated therein is not possi
ble because the mortgage loans available 
are not homogeneous with the securitised portfolio in terms of the amount, the 
residual term, the interest rate, the characteristics of the mortgagor, the 
characteristics of the mortgaged property, or Receivable Nominal 

Balance/appraised value ratio, the Selle
r undertakes to proceed to the early 
redemption of the Certificate in question, by reimbursing, in cash, both the 

outstanding capital of the Certificate in question and the interest accrued and 
unpaid to date, as well as payable any other amount owing to the Fund with respect 
to the Certificate in question, by depositing it in the Treasury Account. The 

amounts received from the Certificates in question in the aforementioned 

circumstances will be added to the Av
ailable Funds and applied on the next 
Payment Date subject to the Priority of Payment Order or the Liquidation Priority 

of Payment Order, as appropriate. 
In particular, if the Seller changes the term
s and conditions of the Mortgage Loans during 
their lifetime without complying with the lim
its established in the special legislation 
applicable and with the terms agreed betw
een the Fund and the Seller in the Deed of 
Incorporation, and in section 3.7.1 of this 
Additional Building Block and, therefore, such 
modification be absolutely exceptional, the Se
ller will be deemed in unilateral breach of 
its obligations and the Fund will not be held 
responsible. In the event of such breach, the 
Fund, through the Sociedad Gestora, will be 
entitled to (i) seek damages and (ii) seek the 
substitution or reimbursement of the Certificat
es in question, pursuant to the provisions of 
letters (A) and (B) supra.  This will not im
ply that the Seller guarantees the success of the 
transaction, but the necessary redress of 
the effects caused by the breach of its 
obligations, pursuant to article 1,124 of th
e Civil Code. The Sociedad Gestora will 
immediately notify the CNMV whenever Mortga
ge Loans are substituted or redeemed as 
a result of breach by the Seller. The expenses 
incurred in the actions to remedy the breach 
of the Seller will be borne by the latter 
and may not be recovered from the Fund. 
 

 89 
2.2.10
 Insurance policies in relation to the Mortgage Loans 
According to the public deeds in which the 
Mortgage Loans have been formalized, the 
Mortgagor is under the obligation to keep the property guaranteed by a fire insurance 

policy taken out with a solvent company to the 
satisfaction of Caja Madrid and to pay the 
insurance policy premiums on their respective 
due dates. If the Mortgagor fails to do so, 
Caja Madrid may pay them on account of 
the Mortgagor. The information about the 
contracted policies is stored in the physical
 records of Caja Madrid, which is why it 
cannot facilitated because it cannot be extracted 
automatically for the portfolio that is to 
be securitised.  
However, according to figures received from 
the insurance company as at 6 June 2007, a 
78.57% of the total current balance of the Mort
gage Loans to be securitised is insured by 
fire insurance policies issued by Mapfre. 
2.2.11
 Information on the debtors where the securitised assets include obligations of 
five or fewer debtors which are legal persons, or if a single debtor accounts for 

more than 20% of the assets, or where a 
single debtor accounts for a material 
portion of the assets  
Not applicable. 2.2.12
 Details of the relationship, if it is material to the issue, between the Issuer, 
guarantor and obligor 
No type of direct or indirect ownership or 
control relationship is known to exist between 
any of the Mortgagors and, where appli
cable, the guarantors, and the Seller. 
2.2.13
 Where the assets comprise fixed income assets, description of the principal 
terms and conditions Not applicable. 2.2.14
 Where the assets include equity securities, description of the principal terms 
and conditions  Not applicable. 2.2.15
 Where more than 10% of the securitised a
ssets comprise equity securities that 
are not traded on a regulated or equivalent market, a description of the 
principal terms and conditions  Not applicable. 2.2.16
  A valuation report setting out the valuation of the property  and the cash flow 
/ income streams if an important part of the assets is backed 
It is expressly declared that the buildings 
backing the Mortgage Loans have not been 
appraised on the occasion of this issue, such th
at the valuations  of them described in 


 90 
section 2.2.2 of this Additional Building Bloc

Building Block, by means of the issue of th
e Certificates, will take place on the Date of

to accrue the corresponding interest, beginning 
on the Date of Incorporation (inclusive), 
in other words, 11 July 2007, with the result that the interest accrued on the Mortgage 
Loans from the Date of Incorporation will be 
for the benefit of the Fund, irrespective of 
the actual accrual period used to calcula

The Seller will not assume any responsibilit
y whatsoever for non-payment by the 
mortgagors, whether for principal, interest, or any other amount which the Mortgagors 

may owe pursuant to the Mortgage Loans. Likewi
se, it will not be held liable, in any form

Certificates on behalf of the Fund. 
The price of the Certificates will be the amount equivalent to the sum of (i) the 
Receivable Nominal Balance of the Mortgage Lo

obtained through the issue of the Bonds and from the Accrued Interest Loan (such as the 

latter is defined in section 3.4.3.1 of the A
dditional Building Block). Postponement of the 
payment will not accrue interest. 
In the event of termination of the incorpor

 94 
3.3.3 Description of the rights conferred upon the Fund for the subscription of the 
Mortgage Loan Certificates  
The Fund, as legal holder of the  Certificates, will hold the rights generally recognised by 
applicable law and in the Certificates. Speci
fically, the Fund will be entitled to receive the 
payments which, beginning on the Date of In
corporation, are made by the Mortgagors, 
with the exceptions noted in the following paragraph, as well as any other payments 

arising from the Mortgage Loans, whenever
 they are made in accordance with the 
Certificates. In particular, the Fund will be entitled to receive the amounts accrued as 
ordinary interest on the capital of the Mortgage Loans, including the Accrued Interest.  
In addition to the payments made by the 
Mortgagors, the Fund will be entitled to any 
other payment received by the Seller on the Mort
gage Loans, as servicer of these loans, 
including those arising from any right rela
ted to the Mortgage Loans such as those 
payments arising from insurance policies, paym
ents made by possible guarantors, etc.  
with the exception of default interest, f
ees for the collection of unpaid amounts, 
assumption fees, early redemption/cancellation fees, as well as any other fee or payment 

to which the Seller of the Certificates is entitled.  
In addition, the Fund will be entitled to rece
ive amounts, goods, or rights as payment of 
principal or interest on the Mortgage Loan
s, whether based on liquidation price or an 
amount determined by a court order or other 
enforcement action of a mortgage guarantee, 
by the transfer or liquidation of the real estate awarded or as a consequence of the 

aforementioned enforcement actions, as the acting administrator and manager of the 

properties in the process of foreclosure. The Seller agrees to provide the appropriate 

notifications that, depending on the case, are needed in order for said payments to be 
made to the Sociedad Gestora.  
Without prejudice to what has been declared in point 18 of section 2.2.8.3 of this 
Additional Building Block, should any of the Mortgagors object to the setoff, the Seller 

will inform the Sociedad Gestora accordingly 
and pay the Fund the amount of the setoff 
amount to which the Fund is entitled, plus an
y damages that may have been caused to the 
Fund, in which case the Fund must furnis
h sufficient evidence to the Seller.  3.3.4 Representation and deposit of the Certificates  
The Certificates that will be pooled in th
e Fund will be represented by a registered 
multiple certificate, representing all the 
Certificates issued by CAJA MADRID (the 
ﬁMultiple Certificateﬂ). 
Should the Sociedad Gestora proceed, on behalf and for the account of the Fund, to 
substitute a Mortgage Loan in accordance with
 the provisions of section 2.2.9 of this 
Additional Building Block, to foreclose a 
Mortgage Loan, in accordance with the 
provisions of section 3.7.1 of this Additional Bu
ilding Block, to sell the Certificates in the 
event of the early liquidation of the Fund, on the grounds and according to the terms set 

forth in section 4.4.3 of the Registration Document, or for any other circumstances which 
may arise, the Seller undertakes to divide
 any Multiple Certificate representing the 
Certificates into as many individual or multiples certificates as may be required, or to 

substitute or exchange them, in order 
to achieve the aforementioned purposes.  


 95 
The Multiple Certificate representing the Certif
icates and, in a given case, the individual 
certificates into which they have been divide
d, will remain on deposit with the Financial 
Agent who will act as the depository for them.  
3.3.5 Other legal system requirements for the Certificates 
Pursuant to the provisions of article 67.1 of
 Royal Decree 685/1982, the Certificates will 
be transferrable by written declaration on the 
certificate itself and, generally, by any of 
the means allowed under law, with the acqui
sition and ownership limited to institutional 
or professional investors and not permitted fo
r the non-specialised public, as stipulated in 
article 64.1 of Royal Decree 685/1982. The purchaser must inform the issuer of the 

Certificate both of such a transfer and of the address of the new owner. 
The transferor will not be held responsible for 
the solvency of the issuer of the Certificate 
nor for that of the Mortgagor, nor for the 
adequacy of the Mortgage Loan securing it. 
3.3.6 Notification of the Mortgagors 
CAJA MADRID will continue servicing the 
Mortgage Loans, in
 accordance with the 
provisions of section 3.7.1 of
 this Additional Building Block and of the Deed of 
Incorporation.  The Sociedad Gestora and 
CAJA MADRID will agree not to notify their 
respective Mortgagors of the transfer on the Date of Incorporation.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CAJA M
ADRID is replaced as the servicer of the 
respective Mortgage Loans, as well as in th
e event of CAJA MADRID being declared 
bankrupt or subject to administrative or judi
cial intervention, in accordance with the 
regulation and the bankruptcy proceedings and,
 in any case, at such time as the Sociedad 
Gestora deems it reasonably justified, the la
tter will instruct CAJA MADRID as to its 
obligation to notify the corresponding Mortgagors (and, where applicable, the third-party 
guarantors and the insurance companies from 
which the Mortgagors may have taken out 
the material damage insurance policies associat
ed to the Mortgage Loans) of (i) the sale 
to the Fund of the Mortgages pending reimburse
ment, and (ii) that the payments derived 
therefrom only will release them from their obligations if they are made to the account 

designated and notified by the Sociedad Gestor
a. However, both in the event that CAJA 
MADRID has failed to notify the Mortgagors 
and, where applicable, the third-party 
guarantors and the insurance companies, with
in five (5) Business Days of receiving the 
instruction, and in the event of the bankruptcy
 or liquidation of the Seller as the servicer 
of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgagors and, 
where applicable, the third-party guarantors 
and the insurance companies with which the 
Mortgagors may have taken out the material 
damage insurance policies associated to the 
Mortgage Loans, will be notified by the 
Sociedad Gestora, either directly or by a ne
w servicer appointed by the Sociedad Gestora. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous 
paragraph, in the Deed of Incorporation 
the Seller will grant the Sociedad Gestora the 
broadest powers required in Law to enable 
the latter to inform the respective Mortgagors of
 the issue of the Certificates at such time 
as the Sociedad Gestora deems it appropriate. 
The Seller will bear any expenses incurred in no
tifying the Mortgagors,
 and will not pass 
them onto the Fund. 


 96 
3.4. Explanation of the Flow of Funds 
3.4.1 How the cash flow from the assets will meet the Issuer™s obligations to the 
Bondholders As illustrated in the diagram in section 3.1 
of this Additional Building Block, the cash 
flow from the assets will serve to fulfil the 
obligations of the Issuer as follows:  
a) On the Disbursement Date, the Fund will 
pay the price of the Certificates issued, 
with a portion of the principal amount received from the Class A, B, C, D and E 
Bonds and the amount of Principal of the Accrued Interest Loan. 
b) On such Disbursement Date, the Fund w
ill also receive the amount of the first 
drawdown from the Subordinated Loan and the amount of the Participative Loan. 
c) Likewise, on said Disbursement Date, th
e Reserve Fund will be funded from the 
Participative Loan. d) Every week (except in the circumstan
ces set forth in section 3.4.5.1 of the 
Additional Building Block), on each Collection Date, the Sociedad Gestora, for and 
on behalf of the Fund, will receive the amounts that the Mortgagors have paid for 

the principal and interest since the l
ast Collection Date. These amounts will be 
deposited in the Treasury Account, accruing an
 interest rate in accordance with the 
provisions of the Financial Services Contr
act, which will cover the payments of the 
Fund on each Payment Date, in keeping with the Priority of Payment Order or the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. 
e) The Available Funds will be used on each
 Payment Date to meet the payment 
obligations of the Fund in accordance with 
the Priority of Payment Order or the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order.  
3.4.2 Information on any credit enhancements 
As a mechanism for credit enhancement in
 the event of possible losses from unpaid 
and/or defaulted Certificates and for the purpo
se of allowing payments to be made by the 
Fund in accordance with the Priority of Payment Order or the Liquidation Priority of 

Payment Order, a provision for the establishmen
t of the Reserve Fund,
 the characteristics 
of which are set forth in section 3.4.2.1. below, has been made.  
Similarly, the subordination and the postponeme
nt of the Class B, C, D and E Bonds, in 
the payment of interest and the return of pr
incipal which results from their ranking in the 
Priority of Payment Order and in the Liquida
tion Priority of Payment Order, constitute a 
protection mechanism between the different Classes of Bonds. 
In order to mitigate the interest rate risk whic
h exists due to the fact
 that the Certificates 
are subject to floating interest rates with di
fferent reference indices and different reset and 
settlement periods to the floating interest ra
tes established for each of the Series of Bonds, 
the Sociedad Gestora will enter into an In
terest Swap Agreement, described in section 
3.4.7.1 of this Additional Building Block, 
and three Option Agreements, described in 
section 2 of this Additional Building Block with CAJA MADRID.   


 97 
The Fund will have available, in accordance with
 the provisions of the Financial Services 
Contract, a Treasury Account, into which all the amounts that the Fund must receive from 
the Seller will be paid, on each Collection 
Date, pursuant to the provisions of section 
3.4.4.1 of the Additional Building Block. 
3.4.2.1.
 Reserve Fund 
As a credit enhancement mechanism and for 
the purpose of allowing payments to be 
made by the Fund to the holders of the Class 
A, B, C, D and E Bonds, in accordance with 
the Priority of Payment Order and with the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, a 
reserve fund will be established (the ﬁ
Reserve Fundﬂ ). The Reserve Fund will be initially establishe
d on the Disbursement Date, and funded 
from the Participative Loan, in
 other words, for an amount of one hundred and eight 
million (108,000,000) euros (ﬁ
Initial Reserve Fundﬂ).  On each Payment Date, the funds availabl
e on each Payment Date for that purpose, 
according to the Priority of Payment Order, will be allocated to the Reserve Fund until 

the required level is reached for that Payment Date (the ﬁ
Required Reserve Fund
ﬂ). During the first three (3) years from the Dis
bursement Date, the Required Reserve Fund 
will be the Initial Reserve Fund.  
Once the period of three (3) years indicated in
 the previous paragraph has passed, the new 
Required Reserve Fund will be the smaller of the following amounts: 
(i) Initial Reserve Fund, and  

(ii) the larger of:  
- 7.2% of the Receivable Nominal Balance of the Bonds on the Payment Date 
in question; and 
- 50% of the Initial Reserve Fund. 
Notwithstanding the above, the level of the Reserve Fund must not be reduced (and 
therefore will remain in the Required Reserve Fund on the aforementioned Payment 

Date) when of the following circum
stances occurs on a Payment Date: 
(i) That on the previous Payment Date, the Reserve Fund has not been allocated to 
the level of the Reserve Fund Required on that Payment Date. 
(ii) That the Receivable Nominal Balance of
 the Non Defaulted Certificates more 
than ninety (90) days in arrears exceeds 1.25% of the Receivable Nominal 

Balance of the Non Defaulte
d Certificates, both items measured the last day of 
the Calculation Period immediately prior to the Payment Date in question. 
(iii) That the average margin added to the co
rresponding reference index to determine 
the nominal interest rate of the Mortga
ge Loans, weighted by the Receivable 
Nominal Balance thereof is equal to or less than 0.47%.  


 98 
On the last Payment Date, the Required Reserve Fund will be equal to zero. 
The amounts that form the Reserve Fund will be
 deposited in the Treasury Account under 
the terms referred to in section 3.4.4.
1 of this Additional Building Block. 
3.4.3 Details of any subordinated debt financing 
The Seller will grant the Fund an Accrued In
terest Loan, a Subordinated Loan and a 
Participative Loan, the main terms and c
onditions whereof are described below.  
3.4.3.1.
 Accrued Interest Loan Agreement 
The Seller will grant, in accord
ance with the provisions of the Accrued Interest Loan 
Agreement, a subordinated loan to the Fund (the ﬁ
Accrued Interest Loan
ﬂ and the ﬁAccrued Interest Loan Agreement
ﬂ, respectively) for a maximum total amount of 
seven million (7,000,000) euros. 
The amount of the Accrued Interest Loan w
ill be allocated by the Sociedad Gestora 
exclusively to pay the part of the price of 
the Certificates that corresponds to the Accrued 
Interest, pursuant to section 3.3.2. of the Additional Building Block.  
The amount of the Accrued Interest Loan w
ill be delivered on the Disbursement Date by 
means of a deposit into the Treasury Account.  
The interest on the Accrued Interest Loan w
ill be calculated on the basis of a floating 
annual rate payable on each Payment Date e
qual to the Bond Reference Interest Rate 
determined for each Interest Accrual Period plus
 a margin identical to
 the one applicable 
to the Class E Bonds. The interest will be
 settled on each Payment Date, and will be 
calculated on the following basis: (i) the actua
l effective days in each Interest Accrual 
Period and (ii) a 360 day year.  
The amount and the definitive margin of the A
ccrued Interest Loan will be determined by 
the Sociedad Gestora on the Date of Incorporation, and the second (2
nd) Business Day 
prior to the date of Disbursement, respectiv
ely. The Sociedad Gestora will proceed to 
notify CAJA MADRID: 
- the definitive Amount of the Accrued Interest Loan before 1.00 p.m. (CET) of the 
Date of Incorporation; and  
- definitive margin of the Accrued Interest Loan on the second (2
nd) Business Day 
prior to the Date of Disbursement (when 
the Arranger has notified it of the margins 
applicable to the Bonds of each Series).  
The definitive margin of the Accrued Inter
est Loan will be stated in the notarial 
disbursement record. 
On each Payment Date, starting with the 
first Payment Date, and until the Accrued 
Interest Loan is repaid in full, the Fund w
ill deliver to CAJA MADRID, as  repayment of 
the principal of the Accrued Interest Loan, the remainder of the Available Funds after the 


 99 
payment of the other obligations that rank higher in the Priority of Payment Order or the 
Liquidation Priority of Payment Order. 
All of the amounts that are to be paid to the Seller, whether for the payment of accrued 
interest or for the repayment of principal of 
the Accrued Interest Loan, will be paid only 
if the Fund has sufficient liquidity available and will be subject to the Priority of Payment 

Order or to the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, as appropriate.   
All of the amounts which, as specified in the prior paragraphs, have not been paid to the 
Seller will be paid on the following Payment 
Dates in which the Available Funds permit 
said payment according to the Priority of Paym
ent Order or to the Liquidation Priority of 
Payment Order and will be paid in preferen
ce to the amounts required to be paid under 
the Accrued Interest Loan on said Payment Date.  
The amounts owing to the Seller and remaining unpaid according to the provisions of the 
prior paragraphs will not accrue 
default interest in its favour. 
3.4.3.2.
 Subordinated Loan Agreement 
The Seller will grant, in accordance with 
the provisions of the subordinated loan 
agreement, a subordinated loan to the Fund (the ﬁ
Subordinated Loan
ﬂ and the 
ﬁSubordinated Loan Agreement
ﬂ, respectively) for a maximum total available amount 
of twenty-six million three hundred and sixt
y thousand seven hundred and seventy-three 
euros and sixty-six eurocents (•26,360,773.66). 
The Fund will draw down the Subordinated Loan twice, as follows: 

(i) A first drawdown, for a maximum amount of seven million five hundred and ten 
thousand seven hundred and seventy-thr
ee euros and sixty-six eurocents  
(•7,510,773.66), which will be delivered on the Date of Disbursement by deposit 
into the Treasury Account, and which will 
be allocated by the Sociedad Gestora 
exclusively to pay the Initial Expenses. The definitive amount of the first 

drawdown will be determined by th
e Sociedad Gestora on the Second (2
nd) Business Day prior to the Disbursement Da
te when the Arranger has notified it of 
the definitive underwriting and placement f
ees. The Sociedad Gestora will proceed 
to notify CAJA MADRID of the definitiv
e amount of the first drawdown under the 
Subordinated Loan before 1.00 p.m. (CET) of the Second (2
nd) Business Day prior 
to the Disbursement Date.  
(ii) A second drawdown, which will amount to a maximum amount of eighteen million 
eight hundred and fifty thousand (18,850,
000) euros, which will be delivered on 
the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the first 
Payment Date by deposit into the 
Treasury Account, and which will be allocated
 by the Sociedad Gestora exclusively 
to cover the difference on the first Paymen
t Date, between the interest accrued by 
the Certificates until the Payment Date and the interest received from the 

Certificates due prior to such Payment Date. The definitive amount of second 

drawdown will be determined by the 
Sociedad Gestora before the second (2
nd) Business Day prior to the first Payment Date. 


 100 
The balances drawn under the Subordinated Lo
an and subject to repayment will accrue 
interest on the basis of a variable annual inte
rest rate payable on ea
ch Payment Date equal 
to the Reference Rate of interest of the Bonds
 determined for each Interest Accrual Period plus a margin identical to the one applicab
le to the Class E Bonds. The interest will be 
settled on each Payment Date, and will be calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual 

effective days in each Interest Accrual Pe
riod and (ii) a 360 day year. The undrawn part 
of the maximum amount available of the S
ubordinated Loan will not accrue Interest. 
The definitive margin of the 
Subordinated Loan will be de
termined by the Sociedad 
Gestora on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Date
 of Disbursement, when the 
Arranger has notified it of the margins applicab
le to the Bonds of each Series and it will 
proceed immediately to notify CAJA MADRID accordingly. 
The definitive margin of the Subordinated 
Loan will be documented in the notarised 
disbursement document. 
The Fund will deliver to CAJA MADRID, 
in repayment of the amounts drawn down 
under the Subordinated Loan and to the full 
repayment of the balance drawn down under 
the Subordinated Loan, the remainder of th
e Available Funds after paying the other

 All of the amounts that are to be paid to the Seller, both for the payment of accrued 
interest and as repayment of the amounts 
drawn down under the Subordinated Loan, will 
be paid only if the Fund has sufficient liqui
dity available and will be subject to the 
Priority of Payment Order or to the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, as appropriate. 
All of the amounts which, as specified in the prior paragraphs, have not been paid to the 
Seller will be paid on the following Payment 
Dates in which the Available Funds permit 
said payment according to the Priority of Paym
ent Order or to the Liquidation Priority of 
Payment Order, as appropriate, and will be paid
 in preference to the amounts required to 
be paid under the Subordinate
d Loan on said Payment Date. 
The amounts owing to the Seller and remaining unpaid according to the provisions of the 
prior paragraphs will not accrue 
default interest in its favour. 
3.4.3.3.
 Participative Loan Agreement 
The Seller will grant, in accordance with 
the provisions of the Participative Loan 
Agreement, a subordinated loan to the Fund (the ﬁ
Participative Loanﬂ), and the ﬁParticipative Loan Agreement
ﬂ, respectively),  which the Sociedad Gestora will use to 
fund the Initial Reserve Fund. 
The total amount of the Participative Lo
an will be one hundred and eight million 
(108,000,000) euros. 
The amount of the Participative Loan will be
 delivered on the Disbursement Date by 
means of a deposit into the Treasury Account. 
The Participative Loan will be redeemed on 
each Payment Date, by an amount equal to 
the amount by which the Required Reserve Fund is reduced on each Payment Date, 

pursuant to the Priority of Payment Order or to the Liquidation Priority of Payment 

Order, as appropriate.  The interest on the Participative Loan w
ill be calculated based on a floating annual 
interest rate, payable on each Payment Date, equal to the Reference Interest Rate 

determined for each Interest Accrual Period plus
 a margin identical to
 the one applicable 
to the Class E Bonds.  The definitive margin of
 the Participative Loan will be determined 
by the Sociedad Gestora on the second (2
nd) Business Day prior to the Date of 
Disbursement, when the Arranger has notified it of the margins applicable to the Bonds of 
each Series.  The interest will be settled on 
each Payment Date, and will be calculated on 
the following basis: (i) the actual effective da
ys in each Interest Accrual Period and (ii) a 
360 day year. 
The definitive margin of the Participative Loan
 will be stated in the notarial disbursement 
record.  

 102 
All of the amounts that are to be paid to th
e Seller pursuant to the provisions set forth in 
the previous paragraphs, will be subject to 
the Priority of Payment Order or to the 
Liquidation Priority of Paymen
t Order, as appropriate.  All of the amounts which, as specified in the prior paragraphs, have not been paid to the 
Seller will be paid on the following Payment 
Dates in which the Available Funds permit 
said payment according to the Priority of Paym
ent Order or to the Liquidation Priority of 
Payment Order, as appropriate, and will be paid
 in preference to the amounts required to 
be paid under the Participative Loan on said Payment Date.  
The amounts owing to the Seller and remaining unpaid according to the provisions of the 
prior paragraphs will not accrue 
default interest in its favour. 
3.4.3.4.
 Subordination of the Bonds 
In terms of payment of interest and reimbur
sement of principal, the Class E Bonds rank 
after the Class A, B, C and D Bonds. In term
s of payment of interest and reimbursement 
of principal, the Class D Bonds rank after the Class A, B and C Bonds. In terms of 

payment of interest and reimbursement of 
principal, the Class C Bonds rank after the 
Class A and B Bonds. In terms of payment of in
terest and reimbursement of principal, the 
Class B Bonds rank after the Class A Bonds. All 
this in accordance with the Priority of 
Payment Order or the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, as appropriate. 
Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 of the Securities Note specify how the interest and principal 
reimbursement payments of the Bonds of each 
Class rank in the Fund priority of payment 
order.  
Should the circumstances causing the pro rata redemption of the Class A, B, C, D and E 
Bonds set forth in section 4.9.4 of the Secur
ities Note arise, there will be no subordination 
in the reimbursement of principal of the Bonds of these Classes.  
3.4.4 Parameters for the investment of temporary liquidity surpluses and a 
description of the parties responsible for such investment 
The investment parameters for the liquidi
ty surpluses of the Fund are listed in the 
Financial Services Contract, which regulates the Treasury Account. 
3.4.4.1.
 Treasury Account 
The Fund will have available through the Financial Agent, as per the provisions of the 
Financial Services Contract, a bank account 
opened on behalf of the Fund (the "
Treasury 
Account"), that will be used to pay all the amounts that the Fund must receive from the 
Seller derived from the Mortgage Loans and, 
following the instructions of the Sociedad 
Gestora, to make all the payments of the F
und, in accordance with Priority of Payment 
Order or to the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, as appropriate. 
The Financial Agent will provide to the Fund all of the customary services relating to the 
maintenance and administration of said account, in accordance with normal banking 

practices. Any costs charged for the maintena
nce of such account will be charged to the 


 103 
Financial Agent, except for any costs incurre
d due to the negligence of the Sociedad 
Gestora. 
The Treasury Account will not be allowed to ha
ve a negative balance to the detriment of 
the Fund. The balances in the Treasury 
Account will remain as available cash. 
Whenever the Fund has a positive balance in
 the Treasury Account, such balance will 
accrue a floating annual interest rate, in favour of the Fund, equal to the result of reducing 

(i) the Reference Interest Rate applicable to
 the Bonds in each Interest Accrual Period by 
(ii) a margin of 0.20%. The interest will 
be calculated and settled every quarter, will be 
paid on each Payment Date, and will be calculated on the following basis: (i) the actual 

days that exist in each interest accrual period and (ii) a 360 day year.  
The balances in the Treasury Account in favour
 of the Fund, cannot be used, in any way, 
by the Seller to offset any kind of debt concu
rrently maintained by the Fund or by related 
third parties, unless the Fund has any amount left over once the Available Funds have 
been used to meet the payment obligations set
 forth in the Priority of Payment Order or, 
where applicable, in the Liquidation Priority of Payment Order, and prior written 

approval from the Sociedad Gestora has been obtained.  
In the event that the rating assigned by th
e Rating Agencies to the Financial Agent's 
short-term risk, such Financial Agent's curre
nt ratings being A-1+ (S&P), F1+ (Fitch), 
and P-1 (Moody™s), is modified, the measure
s that are described in section 5.2 of the 
Securities Note will be applicable. 
3.4.5 How payments are collected in respect of the assets 
3.4.5.1.
 Frequency of payments As indicated above, the payments received from the Mortgagors, as well as the 
indemnities that CAJA MADRID receives as
 beneficiary of the damage insurance 
policies and any others amounts to which the 
Fund is entitled as holder of the Certificates, will be deposited in the Treasury Account every Tuesday or, if this is not a Business Day, 

the immediately next Business Day and will 
consist of the income received from the 
Certificates.  Notwithstanding the above, should the rating of CAJA MADRID be 

downgraded below P-1 (Moody™s), F1 (Fitch) or
 A-2 (S&P), the payments received from 
the Mortgagors and the indemnities referred to
 in this section must be paid into the 
Treasury Account every two (2) Business Days
, in addition to furnishing additional 
collateral, if necessary, to maintain the Bond ratings.  
CAJA MADRID, in accordance with the provi
sions of section 3.7.1 of the Additional 
Building Block, and in its capacity as servicer
 of the Mortgage Loans, will not pay any 
amount to the Fund that it has not previously received from the Mortgage Loans pooled in 
the Fund.

 Financial Intermediation Margin CAJA MADRID will be entitled to receive fro
m the Fund a variable and subordinated 
amount as remuneration for its involvement 
in the financial intermediation process 
carried out and that has permitted the fi
nancial transformation defining the Fund's 
activity, the latter's subscription of the Certif
icates, and the rating assigned to each Series 
of Bonds (the ﬁ
Financial Intermediation Marginﬂ). Such remuneration will be settled every quarter on each Payment Date, for an amount 
equal to the positive difference on each Paym
ent Date between the Available Funds and 
the application of items one (1) to twenty-one 
(21) of the Priority of Payment Order or the 
Liquidation Priority of Paymen
t Order, as appropriate.  This amount will not be deemed a fee or cons
ideration owed on account of the delivery of 
a good or provision of a service to the Fund, 
but instead will be deemed as remuneration 
for the financial intermediation process carried out by CAJA MADRID by issuing the 

Certificates pooled in the Fund.  
3.4.6.5.
 Fund Expenses Pursuant to the provisions of the Priority of Payment Order and the Liquidation Priority 
of Payment Order, described in the previous
 paragraphs, the Sociedad Gestora will pay, 
and charge to the Fund, all of the Fund 
operating expenses, including both the Initial 
Expenses and the Ordinary Expenses and 
the Extraordinary Expenses that accrue 
throughout its life. 
(i) Initial expenses 
Fund incorporation expenses and Bond issue expenses (the ﬁ
Initial Expensesﬂ), an 
estimate of which is contained in section 6 of the Securities Note. The initial expenses 
will be paid with the amount drawn down 
from the Initial Expenses Loan and without 
being subject to the Priority of Payment Order or to the Liquidation Priority of Payment 

Order. (ii) Expenses throughout the life of the Fund 
The Sociedad Gestora will pay, and charge to
 the Fund, all  operating expenses, including 
both the periodic ordinary expenses and also 
the extraordinary expenses that accrue 
throughout its life, and such expenses will be 
paid in their respective Priority of Payment 
Order or Liquidation Priority of Payment Order.  
Merely by way of illustration, the Socied
ad Gestora will pay the following expenses: 
 The following are considered ordinary expenses 
ﬁOrdinary Expensesﬂ): expenses 
that may arise from mandatory administrative verifications, registrations and 
authorisations not included in the Initial 
Expenses; the fees payable to the Ratings 
Agencies for monitoring and maintaining th
e rating of the Bonds; expenses relating 
to the Bonds bookkeeping, involving their representation by the book-entry system, 


 110 
their admission to trading on the organised
 secondary markets and the maintenance 
of all of the above, not included in the 
Initial Expenses; the expenses incurred in 
servicing the Fund; the expenses incurred in 
the annual financial audit of the Fund; 
the expenses incurred in the redemption of 
the Bonds; the expenses incurred in the 
announcements and notifications relative
 to the Fund and/or the Bonds; the 
financial expenses of the Bond Issue and th
e fee of the Financial Agent and of the 
Sociedad Gestora. 
It is estimated that the Ordinary Expenses during the first year of the life of the 
Fund will amount to six hundred and eighty-
eight thousand (688,000) euros. It is 
expected that the annual amount of Ordi
nary Expenses will drop throughout the life 
of the Fund due to the fact that the amount of some of the Ordinary Expenses of the 

Fund are calculated as a percentage on the cu
rrent balance of the transaction, which 
logically will drop over time. 
 The following are considered extraordinary expenses (ﬁ
Extraordinary 
Expensesﬂ): Should this be the case, expenses arising from the preparation and 
formal execution of the amendment of the D
eed of Incorporation and of the Fund's 
Contracts, as well as for the execution of 
additional contracts;  where applicable, 
the amount of Initial Expenses that exceeds the amount of the first drawdown 

under the Subordinated Loan; extraordinar
y audit and legal advice expenses; any 
expenses incurred in the sale of the Certif
icates and of the remaining assets of the 
Fund when it is liquidated; the expenses 
required for initiating the enforcement of 
the Mortgage Loans and those arising from the necessary recovery actions; the 

consideration payable to the servicer of the Mortgage Loans if the Seller is 

substituted as the servicer thereof; in gene
ral, any other extraordinary expenses 
incurred by the Fund or by the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and for the account 
of the same. 
 Any expenses that are incurred in liqui
dating the Fund will be considered 
liquidation expenses (ﬁLiquidation Expenses"
). 
3.4.7 Other arrangements upon which payments of interest and principal to 
investors are dependent 3.4.7.1.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in a pe
rmanent situation of alteration of the 
financial equilibrium of the Fund, the Socied
ad Gestora, for and on behalf of the Fund, 
will endeavour to enter into a new Interest Swap Agreement. 
Expiry of the Interest Swap Agreement 
The early termination of the Interest Swap 
Agreement will not in itself constitute a reason 
for the early expiry of the Fund, or its Early Liquidation, unless the termination occurs in 
conjunction with other events or circumstances 
related to the Fund™s net worth, producing 
a substantial or permanent change in its financial equilibrium. 
The Interest Swap Agreement will expire on th
e earlier of (i) the Legal Maturity Date and 
(ii) the date on which one the grounds for the extinction of the Fund occurs. 
Rating change events 
For the purposes of complying with the Criteri
a of Fitch, Moody™s and S&P, Party A will 
give an irrevocable undertaking to notif
y the Sociedad Gestora, as soon as such 
circumstance occurs, throughout the life of 
the Bond Issue, if the long and short term 
ratings it has been assigned by the Rating Agencies are modified or withdrawn. 


 115 
Fitch's Criteria
 Party A will give an irrevocable undertaking that if, at any time throughout the life of the 
Bond Issue, the rating of the non-subordina
ted and unsecured debt of Party A is 
downgraded to below A and/or F1 (Fitch), th
en within a maximum of thirty (30) days 
from when said circumstances occurred, Part
y A will implement one of the following 
options under the terms and conditions that th
e Sociedad Gestora deems appropriate, after 
notifying the Rating Agencies, in order to 
maintain the ratings assigned to each of the 
Series by Fitch:  
(i) to find a third party that is rated A and F1 or higher (Fitch), to stand as surety for 
the performance of its contractual obligations;  
(ii) to find a third party that has the same
 ratings as option (i) above, that will assume 
the same rights and obligations as assumed by 
Party A in the Interest Swap Agreement 
either by being subrogated in it or by virtue
 of new agreements in
 terms and conditions 
substantially identical to the Interest Swap
 Agreement and to the transactions involved, 
provided that the ratings assigned to the Bonds by Fitch; or 
(iii) make a deposit consisting of cash or of securities in favour of the Fund, in an 
account opened in another entity which has been 
assigned a short-term risk rating equal to 
or higher than F1 (Fitch), as a guarantee for the contractual obligations of Party A. The 
amount will be calculated using the market value of the specific transaction, including the 
fee that would become payable in the event of the Substitution of the Seller in its capacity 

as Mortgage Loans servicer, so as not to impair the rating assigned to the each Series of 

Bonds in accordance with the requirements of
 the Rating Agencies' Swap Criteria n force 
at that time. For these purposes, the ﬁSwap Cr
iteria of the Rating Agenciesﬂ will be the 
official criteria published by Fitch that are in
 force from time to time and which lay down 
the guidelines for quantifying the amount of the aforementioned deposit.  
Where applicable and, in terms of the sever
ity of the possible downgrading of the ratings 
assigned to the Bonds by Fitch, the latter may c
onsider that only options (i) and (ii) above 
are valid, in which case it will notify the Soci
edad Gestora and Party A, and the latter 
must adopt of one the said options within a maximum of ten (10) Business Days.

Levelﬂ), Party A will implement one of the 
following measures within thirty (30) 
Business Days of such circumstance occurring: 
a) Find a Substitute with the Required Firs
t Rating Level (or else a Substitute that has 
a Guarantor with the Required First Rating Level); 
b) Find a Guarantor with the Required First Rating Level; or 


 116 
c) Make a deposit consisting of cash or of

(ii) If, at any time throughout the lifetime of the Bond Issue, neither Party A nor any of 
its Guarantors has the Required Second Rating Level (ﬁ
Breach of the Second Rating 
Levelﬂ), Party A, acting diligently, will procure, in the shortest possible time frame, to: 
a) Find a Substitute with the Required Sec
ond Rating Level (or else a Substitute that 
has a Guarantor with the Required Second Rating Level); 
b) Find a Guarantor with the Required Second Rating Level. 

Until the alternatives described above are implem
ented, Party A will, within the period of 
thirty (30) Business Days granted from the o
ccurrence of the Breach of the Second Rating Level, make a deposit consisting of cash or of 
securities in favour of the Fund in an entity 
that  is rated P-1 (Moody™s), for an amount that does not have a negative impact on the 
rating of the Bonds by Moody´s.  
The obligations of Party A under sections (i
) and (ii) above, as well as the Grounds of 
Early Termination derived therefrom, will onl
y remain in force while the grounds that 
gave rise to the Breach of the First Rating Level or the Breach of the Second Rating 

Level, respectively, continue to exist. Th
e amount of the deposit that Party A may have 
made under sections (i) and (ii) above will be 
returned to Party A when the grounds that 
gave rise to the Breach of the First Rating Level or the Breach of the Second Rating 

Level, respectively, cease to exist.  
For the purposes of this section: 

- ﬁGuarantorﬂ means the entity that provides an 
unconditional, irrevocable and first 
demand guarantee with respect to the present 
and future obligations of Party A (the 
ﬁGuaranteeﬂ), and provided that (A) a law firm provides a legal opinion confirming that

S&P's criteria
 According to the updated S&P counterparty criterion ﬁ
Revised Framework For Applying 
Counterparty And Supporting Party Criteria
ﬂ published on 8 May 2007:  
- Should the rating of Party A be downgraded, at any moment throughout the 
lifetime of the Bond issue, below A-2 (S&P),
 Party A may continue being an eligible 
counterparty provided it agrees to collateraliz
e, within 10 business days, 100% of the 
mark-to-market of the Interest Swap Agreem
ent, calculated in accordance with S&P's 
criteria. 
- Should it not choose the previous option, Party A will become an ineligible 
counterparty to the transaction and must, within sixty (60) business days: 
(i) Replace the ineligible counterparty with 
another entity that is rated at least A-1 
(S&P).  (ii) Obtain from a financial institution deemed
 appropriate by S&P and that is rated at 
least A-1 (S&P), a first demand bank guarantee to guarantee the obligations of the 

ineligible counterparty under 
the Interest Swap Agreement. 
- Should the rating of Party A be downgraded, at any moment throughout the 
lifetime of the Bond issue, to A-3 (S&P), it w
ill become an ineligible counterparty to the 
transaction and must, within sixty (60) busin
ess days, implement option (i) or (ii) above.  
Meanwhile, within ten (10) Business Days, th
e ineligible counterparty must increase the 
previously established collateralization by 25% of the market value of the Interest Swap 

Agreement in accordance with the criteria of S&P. 
Any replacement, guarantee or investment will 
be subject to confirmation of the Bond 
rating by S&P. All the costs incurred in any 
of the actions defined above will be for the 
account of the ineligible counterparty.

per se, constitute sufficient cause for the early
 termination of the Fund nor for the Early 
Liquidation thereof, unless in combination with 
other events or circumstances relating to 
the net worth of the Fund, a substantial or 
permanent change occurs in its financial 
equilibrium. 
The Option Agreements will expire on the earlier

Fitch's Criteria
 The Payer of the Option Variable Amount will 
give an irrevocable undertaking that if, at 
any time throughout the life of the Bond Issu
e, the rating of the non-subordinated and 
unsecured debt of the Payer of the Option Va
riable Amount is downgraded to below A 
and/or F1 (Fitch), then within thirty (30)
 days from when said circumstances occurred, 
the Payer of the Option Variable Amount w
ill implement one of the following options 
under the terms and conditions that the So
ciedad Gestora deems appropriate, after 
notifying this Rating Agency, in order to 
maintain the ratings assigned to each of the 
Series by Fitch:  
(i)  to find a third party that is rated A and F1 or higher (Fitch), to stand as surety for 
the performance of its contractual obligations;  
(ii) to find a third party that has the same
 ratings as option (i) above, that will assume 
the same rights and obligations as assumed 
by the Payer of the Option Variable Amount 
in the Option Agreements either by being subrogated in them or by virtue of new 
agreements in terms and conditions substantia
lly identical to the Option Agreements and 
to the transactions involved, provided that 
the ratings assigned to the Bonds by the Rating 
Agencies are not impaired; or 
(iii) make a deposit consisting of cash or of securities in favour of the Fund, in an 
account opened in another entity which has been 
assigned a short-term risk rating equal to 
or higher than F1 (Fitch), as a guarantee for th
e contractual obligations of the Payer of the 
Option Variable Amount. The amount will be cal
culated using the market value of the 
specific transaction, including the fee that 
would become payable in the event of the 
Substitution of the Seller in its capacity as Mort
gage Loans servicer, so as not to impair 
the rating assigned to the each Series of Bonds 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Rating Agencies' Swap Criteria in force at
 that time. For these purposes, the ﬁSwap 
Criteria of the Rating Agenciesﬂ will be the offi
cial criteria published by Fitch that are in 
force from time to time and which lay down
 the guidelines for quantifying the amount of 
the aforementioned deposit.  
Where applicable and, in terms of the sever
ity of the possible downgrading of the ratings 
assigned to the Bonds by Fitch, the latter may c
onsider that only options (i) and (ii) above 
are valid, in which case it will notify the Soci
edad Gestora and the Payer of the Option

Variable Amount, and the latter must adopt one of such options within ten (10) Business 
Days. 
Moody™s Criteria
 The Payer of the Option Variable Amount will give the following irrevocable 
undertakings under the Option Agreements: 
(i) If, at any time throughout the lifetime of the Bond issue, neither the Payer of the 
Option B Variable Amount nor any of its Guar
antors has the Required First Rating Level 
(ﬁBreach of the First Rating Level
ﬂ), then within thirty (30) days from when said 
circumstances occurred, the Payer of the Op
tion Variable Amount will implement one of 
the following options: a) Find a Substitute with the Required Firs
t Rating Level (or else a Substitute that has 
a Guarantor with the Required First Rating Level); 
b) Find a Guarantor with the Required First Rating Level; or 
c) Make a deposit consisting of cash or of 
securities in favour of the Fund in an entity 
that is rated P-1 (Moody™s), granted for an 
amount that does not have a negative impact 
on the rating of the Bonds by Moody™s. 
(ii) If, at any time throughout the lifetime of the Bond Issue, neither the Payer of the 
Option B Variable Amount nor any of its Guarantors has the Required Second Rating 
Level (ﬁBreach of the Second Rating Level
ﬂ), Party B, acting diligently, will procure, in 
the shortest possible time frame, to: 
a)  Find a Substitute with the Required S
econd Rating Level (or else a Substitute that 
has a Guarantor with the Required Second Rating Level ); 
b) Find a Guarantor with the Required Second Rating Level. 
Until the alternatives described above are implem
ented, the Payer of the Option Variable 
Amount will, within thirty (30) Business Days
 from the occurrence of
 the Breach of the 
Second Rating Level, make a deposit consisting 
of cash or of securities in favour of the 
Fund in an entity that is rate
d P-1 (Moody™s), for an amount that does not have a negative 
impact on the rating of the Bonds by Moody´s.  
The obligations of the Payer of the Option Variable Amount under points (i) and (ii) 
above, as well as the Grounds of Early Termin
ation derived therefrom, will only remain 
in force while the grounds that gave rise to 
the Breach of the First Rating Level or the 
Breach of the Second Rating Level, respectively, continue to exist. The amount of the 

deposit that the Payer of the Option Variable
 Amount may have made under sections (i) 
and (ii) above will be returned to the Pa
yer of the Option Variable Amount when the 
grounds that gave rise to the Breach of the First Rating Level or the Breach of  the 
Second Rating Level, respectively, cease to exist.

maturing before the next Bond Payment Date).
 The balances may be invested for periods 
of more than sixty (60) Business Days and less than as determined by the next Bond 

Payment Date provided that a clause is include
d that stipulates that such investment must 
be cancelled within a maximum of sixty 
(60) Business Days of the rating being 
downgraded. 
Any replacement, guarantee or investment will 
be subject to confirmation of the Bond 
rating by S&P. All the costs incurred in any 
of the actions defined above will be for the 
account of the ineligible counterparty.

right to the privileges and powers conferred 
upon it by Law in its capacity as collection manager of the Fund and servicer of the

liable for any loss, liability, claim or expe
nse suffered or incurred by the Sociedad 
Gestora, or by the Fund, as a result of the provision of services by the Seller as

red to compensate the Fund or the Sociedad

At all events, the Fund, through the Sociedad
 Gestora, may take legal action against the 
Seller in the event of non-compliance of its
 obligations as defined in the contractual 
documents entered into by the Se
ller and the Sociedad Gestora.  
2.- Mortgage Loan Servicing Services
 1. Custody and collection management
 The Seller will devote the same amount of tim
e and attention to servicing the Mortgage 
Loans, and exercise the same degree of expe
rtise, care and diligence in servicing them, 
that it would employ in servicing mortgage loans that had not been sold. In any event, it 
will exercise a reasonable degree of exper
tise, care and diligence when providing the 
services. 
The Seller, as servicer of the Mortgage Loans,
 will remain subject to the criteria set forth 
in the "Internal Memo on Granting of Mortgage 
Loans" that is attached to the Deed of 
Incorporation, and may modify the Mortgage 
Loans in accordance with
 the provisions of 
sections 2, 6, 7 and 8 of this Additional Build
ing Block, provided that such modifications 
do not impair the servicing of the Mortgage Lo
ans, are reported to the Sociedad Gestora 
and are not, in any way, detrimental to the rating assigned to the Bonds by the Rating 

Agencies.  
Specifically, the Seller, as servicer of the Mort
gage Loans, will keep every notarial deed, 
document and file relating thereto, and to any other right accessory to the Mortgage 
Loans, as well as any pertinent documents relating thereto, under safe custody, and will 
not relinquish the possession, custody or contro
l of the Mortgage Loans without the prior 
written consent of the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the Fund, unless such 

relinquishment is (i) in favour of an appointed
 subcontractor or delegate, providing that 
this is permitted by the current regulations; or
 (ii) to allow the Seller to bring proceedings 
for the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loans, as servicer of the Mortgage Loans; 
The Seller, as servicer of the Mortgage Loans, will collect every amount due and payable 
under the Mortgage Loans or any right accessory
 to them and will make every efforts to 
ensure the collection of all payments to be 
made by the Mortgagors or by other persons, 
under the Mortgage Loans or any other right 
accessory to them, in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of such Mortgage 
Loans and on the corresponding dates.  In the event of discrepancies between the 
Seller and the Sociedad Gestora about the 
amount corresponding to the Fund on each 
Collection Date, regarding the collected 


 129 
amount, both parties will make every effort to
 settle such discrepancies. However, should 
no agreement be reached before the Collecti
on Date, the Seller will provisionally deliver 
the Fund the amount established by the Sociedad Gestora and sufficiently justified to 

Seller, notwithstanding subsequent adjustments of such amount. 
2. Actions against Mortgagors in Arrears
 Pursuant to article 25 of Royal Decree 685/1982, without the consent of the Sociedad 
Gestora, the Seller, as servicer of the Mort
gage Loans, will not voluntarily cancel the 
mortgages backing the Certificates on any 
grounds other than the payment of the 
Mortgage Loans, waive or settle such mortga
ges, substitute the Mortgage Loans through 
novation, write them off in full or part or defe
r them nor, in general, take any actions that 
may decrease the rating, legal efficiency or economic value of the mortgage or the 

Mortgage Loans. 
Notwithstanding the above, exclusively in the ev
ent of delay in the payments to which the 
Mortgagors are bound, the Seller, as servicer of
 the Mortgage Loans, will be authorised, 
from the Date of Incorporation, to take an
y of the actions described in section 5 (Debt 
collection management. Debt collection phases) of the "Internal Memo on Granting of 

Mortgage Loans" that is attached to th
e Deed of Incorporation, adopting for these 
purposes, from among the alternatives set fort
h therein, the measures that a reasonably 
prudent mortgagee conducting financing transacti
ons in Spain would take (and to that end 
may renew and modify the Mortgage Loans in 
question without being subject to the terms 
and conditions described in sections 6, 7 a
nd 8 and without such loans having to be 
treated that as renegotiated loans for the pur
poses of such sections), provided that the 
exercise of such discretional rights conforms to the provisions of the ﬁInternal Memo on 
Granting of Mortgage Loansﬂ, does not affect the Fund™s management, the rating 
assigned to the Bonds by the Rating Agencies, nor involve the date of maturity of the 

Mortgage Loan exceeding the Payment Date i
mmediately following the date of the last 
maturity (ordinary or early) currently ag
reed of the Mortgage Loans backing the 
Certificates. 
The Seller, as the servicer of the Mortgage 
Loans sold to the Fund, by virtue of its 
trusteeship thereof or by virtue or the power of
 attorney referred to in the next paragraph, 
may exercise, from among the measures possible 
in accordance with the ﬁInternal Memo 
on Granting of Mortgage Loansﬂ, the legal ac
tion that it deems most suitable against any 
Mortgagors who are in breach of their payment 
obligations with respect to the Mortgage 
Loans. Such legal action must be brought following the corresponding foreclosure 
proceedings, in accordance with the provisions
 of sections 517 et seq. of the Civil 
Procedure Act. For the aforementioned purposes and also for 
the purposes of the provisions of sections 
581.2 and 686.2 of the Civil Procedure Act, and 
in the event that it 
were necessary, in the 
Deed of Incorporation the Sociedad Gestora will grant a power of attorney as broad as 
required by Law to the Seller so that th
e latter, acting through any of its legal 
representatives with sufficient powers for such 
purposes, can, acting for and on behalf of 
the Sociedad Gestora as the legal representativ
e of the Fund, demand, either in or out of 
Court, that the Mortgagor of any of the Mortgage Loans pay its debt
, take any actions to 
recover the defaulted Mortgage Loan (whether 
such actions be in court, out of court or 


 130 
parallel to the foreclosure process)
, and take legal action against such Mortgagor, in 
addition to any other powers required for discharging its duties as the servicer.  
In any case, and if a Mortgagor fails to make 
a payment, the Sociedad Gestora, on behalf 
of the Fund, as its holder, will be entitled to exercise all the rights set forth in Article 66 

of Royal Decree 685/1982. 
In the event of a joinder situation as provided under Article 66, section b), of Royal 
Decree 685/1982, the Seller in question will 
be entitled to award in payment and the 
auction proceeds will be distributed as stated in the aforementioned article without 
prejudice to the possibility of the auction be
ing assigned in accordance with section 655.2 
in connection with section 647.3 of the Civil Procedure Act. 
In the event that any of the situations described
 in sections c) and d) 
of article 66 of Royal 
Decree 685/1982 occur and, as a consequence, th
e Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of the 
Fund, is subrogated to the Seller in the proceed
ings initiated by the Seller, or foreclosure 
proceedings are started, the Sociedad Gestor
a will sell the adjudicated properties in the 
shortest possible time at market conditions. Th
e Seller will hold a right of first refusal for 
the acquisition of any real property mortga
ged to secure the Mortgage Loans that it 
services, and allocated to the Fund, within th
e following ten (10) Business Days from the 
date in which such Seller is notified by the 
Sociedad Gestora, by satisfactory means, of 
the intention to transfer the real property. The right of first refusal will imply that the 
Seller can acquire the real property under the 
same terms and conditi
ons as offered to the 
Sociedad Gestora. 
Any modifications to the Mortgage Loans that might arise from the actions taken against 
the Mortgagors and are authorised from the Date
 of Incorporation in accordance with this 
section will be reported by CAJA MADRID to the Sociedad Gestora via the normal 
channel of communication between them. The Sociedad Gestora will immediately 

forward the information that it receives to the Rating Agencies
. 3. Actions against the Seller The Sociedad Gestora, on behalf of and fo
r the account of the Fund, will be entitled to 
take enforcement proceedings against the Se
ller to collect any past due principal and 
interest of the Mortgage Loans, if the reas
on for the non-payment of such items is not the 
result of non-payment by the Mortgagors. 
Furthermore, should the Seller be in breach of
 the obligations described in the previous 
section, the Fund, through the Sociedad Gestor
a, will be entitled to bring a declaratory 
action against the Seller for breaching its obliga
tions in relation to the Mortgage Loans, 
proceeding pursuant to the provisions of
 the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. 
Upon termination of the Certificates, the Fund,
 through its Sociedad Gestora, will remain 
be entitled to take action against the Selle
r until it has complied with its obligations. 
4. Subcontracting
 The Seller, as the servicer of the Mortgage Lo
ans, will be entitled to subcontract with, or 
delegate on, third parties of recognised solv
ency and capacity vis-à-vis the performance 


 131 
of the duties set forth in subsection 1.- of section 3.7.1 of the Additional Building Block, 
provided that (i) this is legally allowed, (ii)
 beforehand the CNMV has been notified and, 
where applicable, the corresponding authorisati
ons have been obtained, (iii) the Sociedad 
Gestora gives its prior written consent, on beha
lf of the Fund, (iv) the subcontractor or 
delegate has been assigned a rating equal or 
higher to the rating required by the Rating 
Agencies and provided that (v) such subcont
ractor or delegate has waived any action 
claiming liability against the Fund, and to extinguish such subcontracts and/or 
delegations. In any case, neither the Sociedad Gestora nor the Fund will be held liable in any other 
way than pursuant to the provisions cont
ained herein, regarding costs and expenses 
payable or incurred on account of the subcontr
acted or delegated services or arising from 
the termination of any related Contract. 
Notwithstanding any subcontract or delegati
on, the Seller will not be exonerated or 
released by such subcontract 
or delegation from any of the responsibilities accepted in the 
Deed of Incorporation and in the Prospectus. 
5. Substitution of the Seller in its capacity as Mortgage Loans servicer
  Should the Sociedad Gestora find that the Seller, 
as servicer of  the Mortgage Loans, is in 
breach of the obligations stipulated in this 
section as servicer of the respective Mortgage 
Loans, or find about any events that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, imply a 
detriment or serious risk for the financial stru
cture of the Fund or the rights and interests 
of Bondholders, the Sociedad Gestora ma
y, if permitted under the current legal 
framework, (i) substitute the Seller as servicer 
of the Mortgage Loans or (ii) demand that 
the Seller subcontract or delegate the performan
ce of such obligations to or on a person 
who, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora,
 is suitably qualified technically to perform 
such duties. The Sociedad 
Gestora will consider any proposals made by the Seller 
regarding the appointment of its substitute
. The Seller will be bound to execute such 
subcontract or delegation. 
Furthermore, if a corporate, legal or court d
ecision is made or issued for the dissolution, 
winding-up or receivership of the Seller, or the latter files a petition to be declared 
bankrupt, or a Court allows a request filed by 
a third party, or there is any other event 
that, in the opinion of the Sociedad Gestora, 
affects the servicing of the Mortgage Loans, 
the Sociedad Gestora may substitute the Se
ller as servicer of the Mortgage Loans, 
providing that this is permitted by the applicable Law.  
If permitted by the applicable Law, the new 
servicer of the Mortgage Loans will, where 
applicable, be appointed by the Sociedad Gestora, after consulting the competent 
administrative authorities, in order to avoi
d any detriment to the rating assigned to the 
Bonds by the Ratings Agencies, and both th
e latter and the CNMV will be notified of 
such appointment. The Sociedad Gestora may 
agree the amount to be paid with the new 
servicer, at the expense of the Fund, as it deems appropriate, and the said fee will be 
considered an Extraordinary Expense of th
e Fund, which will be paid pursuant to the 
Priority of Payment Order set forth in section 3.4.6.  
If permitted by the applicable Law, the Selle
r may request to be substituted in servicing 
the Mortgage Loans; all expenses incurred in
 such substitution will be at the Seller™s 


 132 
expense. The Sociedad Gestora will authori
se such substitution, provided that the Seller 
has found an entity to substitute it in its ser
vicing capacity, and such substitution is not 
detrimental to the rating assigned to the Bonds
 by the Rating Agencies, and both the latter 
and the CNMV will be notified of such appointment. 
In the event of substitution, the Seller will 
supply the new servicer with the documents 
necessary to provides the services in question. 
6. Modifications to the Mortgage Loans
 Notwithstanding the provisions of article 25 
of Royal Decree 685/1982, referred to in 
section 2 above, the Seller may, without need 
for the consent of th
e Sociedad Gestora, 
make the authorized amendments mentioned 
in the following paragraphs, provided that 
the conditions mentioned in them are met. 
The Seller, as servicer of its Mortgage Loan
s, will be authorised, from the Date of 
Incorporation and with respect to such Mort
gage Loans, provided that the rating assigned 
to the Bonds issued by the Fund is not impaired in any way, to: 
(i) Allow the subrogation of the Mortgage Loan
 contracts, solely in the event that: 
(a) the characteristics of the new Mortgagor are similar to the characteristics of 
the previous Mortgagor;  
(b) the subrogations conform to the criteria established by the Servicer for the 
other Mortgage Loans of its portfolio in its ﬁInternal Memo on Granting of 
Loansﬂ, attached to the Deed of Incorporation; 
(c) the subrogations do not affect the servicing of the Mortgage Loans; and 
(d) provided that the expenses derived from 
this amendment are paid in full by 
the Mortgagors. 
Any other subrogation or transfer of title 
of the Mortgage Loans will require the 
prior authorization of the Sociedad Gestor
a (except, in any case, those carried out 
in accordance with section 2 up supra with
 respect to defaulted Mortgage Loans, 
which are not subject to the provisions of this section 6). 
(ii) Agree with the Mortgagors to modify the interest rate and final maturity of the 
Mortgage Loans, in the manner established in points 7 and 8 below. 
Any modifications that are made to the Mort
gage Loans and are authorised from the Date 
of Incorporation in accordance with points 
(i) and (ii) will be reported by CAJA 
MADRID to the Sociedad Gestora via the normal channel of communication between 

them. The Sociedad Gestora will immediately 
forward the information that it receives to 
the Rating Agencies. 
  

 133 
7. Interest rate modifications
 Pursuant both to the provisions of the Deed of
 Incorporation and this Prospectus, if the 
Seller agrees to modify the interest of 
any Mortgage Loan that it services and, 
consequently, to modify the corresponding Cer
tificate, the Fund will still be entitled to all 
the ordinary interest accrued by the Mortgage Loan.  
The Seller may:  

(i) modify the Reference Interest Rate app
licable to the Mortgage Loans backing the 
issue of the Certificates, provided that the interest rate of the aforementioned 
Mortgage Loans remains floating, and taking 
into account that the total principal of 
the Mortgage Loans whose reference inter
est rate is modified in accordance with 
this section (therefore excluding any Mortga
ge Loans whose interest rate has been 
modified under section 2 ut supra) must not may exceed five per cent (5%) of the 
principal of all the Mortgage Loans sold to
 the Fund on the Date of Incorporation. 
(ii) negotiate a lowering of the interest rate
 differential or margin applicable to the 
Mortgage Loans backing the issue of the 
Certificates, provided that, on the date on 
which, as a result of the renegotiation, th
e differential is lowered, the weighted 
average differential of the Certificates i
ssued by the Seller (excluding from such 
calculation any Certificates whose Mortgage Loans have had their interest rate 
modified under section 2 ut supra)
 is not less than 0.6%, without detriment to the 
fact that, subsequently, the said minimum level may be exceeded as a result of 

circumstances other than the renegotiation 
of the differentials of the Mortgage 
Loans. Under no circumstances will the renegotiation result in the modification of the payment 
intervals, the reset policy or date of the Mo
rtgagee Loan on the Date of Incorporation of 
the Fund. 
Even so, this section will not apply to modi
fications of the defaulted Mortgage Loans, 
which are governed by the provisions of section 2
. 8. Modifications to final maturity of the Mortgage Loans
 The Seller may agree to the novation of the Mo
rtgage Loans that entail a decrease or an 
increase of the residual term of the Mortgage 
Loan in question (due to the decrease or 
increase of the repayment period), albeit subject to the limits, terms and conditions set 

forth in applicable law and in this Prospectus
 and, in particular, to the time limit of the 
maturity of the Certificates, which will not
, under circumstances, exceed the Payment 
Date immediately following the date of the last (ordinary or early) maturity of the 
Mortgage Loans securing the Certificates, and 
taking into account that the total amount of 
the capital or principal sold to the Fund of 
the Mortgage Loans whose maturity date has 
been extended must not exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the capital or principal of all the 

Mortgage Loans sold to the Fund on the Date of Incorporation (excluding from such 

calculation any Certificates whose Mortgage Lo
ans have had their final maturity date 
modified under section 2 ut supra). Additiona
lly, the Seller will only agree to such 
renegotiations provided that the frequency of
 the Mortgage Loan principal repayment 
instalments remains unchanged or is reduced, ev
en if there is a change in the repayment 


 134 
system (which may consist of the constant instalment system or the increasing instalment 
system and which, in the latter case, must not
 exceed five per cent (5%) of the capital or 
principal of all the Mortgage Loans sold 
to the Fund on the Date of Incorporation 
(excluding from such calculation any Certificates whose Mortgage Loans have had their 

repayment system modified under section 2 ut
 supra). Under no circumstances will any 
expenses incurred in such renegotiations be passed onto the Fund. 
The Sociedad Gestora, acting for and on behalf of the Fund, may, after giving the 
Servicer reasonable notice and on justified 
grounds (of force majeure or regarding the 
maintenance of the financial equilibrium of 
the Fund), at any time, throughout the life of 
the Fund, cancel, suspend or modify the Seller™s permission to modify the period of 

maturity or interest. 
In the preceding cases, the modification of the Mortgage Loan will not result in a breach 
of the representations and warra
nties set forth in section 2.2.

Block.  Both the public deeds and the private contr
acts signed in the novation of the terms and 
conditions of the Mortgage Loans, will be kept
